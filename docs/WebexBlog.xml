<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Remember three years ago when we launched our first IP-based conferencing audio device, the directional Cisco Table Microphone Pro? It has been a game-changer ever since, and many of our customers love its sleek elegance, intuitive mute controls, and minimalist design—now available in <a href="https://www.webex.com/us/en/devices/accessories/cisco-table-microphone-pro.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Carbon Black colour</a> too.</p>
<p>Well, we have some exciting news for you! Just two weeks ago at WebexOne 2024 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida we announced <strong>the new </strong><a href="https://www.webex.com/us/en/devices/accessories/cisco-ceiling-microphone-pro.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><strong>Cisco Ceiling Microphone Pro</strong></a><strong> that is orderable now!</strong></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-428829" height="1028" src="https://blog.webex.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/different-setup-ceiling-microphone.jpg" width="1672" /></figure>
<p>In this article, I’d like to dive a bit deeper into why this new ceiling microphone is unlike any other solution when it comes to closing the distance from in-room and remote meeting participants. In addition, I’ll show how the device brings the fastest way to set up your conferencing microphones.</p>
<p>Organizations today are deploying meeting room solutions to enable effective hybrid work. Yet, over 40% of the workforce still feels that meeting spaces are ineffective due to poor audiovisual experiences. In fact, audio quality issues are the topmost meeting room frustration, according to an industry survey conducted by Omdia Research.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s dive a little bit deeper to understand what’s behind this challenge.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">“Can you say that again?”</h2>
<p>Ceiling microphones are a great way to keep technology out of sight. They eliminate the risk that users might mute, obscure, or misplace microphones, which can negatively impact the acoustic experience for remote participants. However, conferencing microphones need to cope with more than just the human voice. They must handle ambient and other background noise, reverberation, and other acoustic challenges in the meeting room. A fixed pickup pattern captures all sounds within the microphone&#8217;s supported pickup range, including these additional noises. In response, various microphone solutions today use beamforming technology to focus on the active speaking participant while minimizing sound from other parts of a meeting room.</p>
<p>But not all these devices are built the same. Many beamforming microphones require an important amount of configuration with specialist design tools to achieve an optimal sound pickup in the spaces where they are installed. Moreover, changes in such spaces usually require reconfiguring the microphone to account for changing participant positions and posture, furniture and other components in the room, modified room geometry, among others. This issue is compounded when there is a change in the room design. When the table composition or seating arrangement changes, IT and Facilities need to reconfigure the microphone to properly cover the new perimeters of the physical meeting zone.</p>
<p>Other solutions feature a single adaptive beam to offer more flexibility. One of our customers, who previously deployed third-party microphones across their meeting rooms, shared an issue they encountered. When more than one person talks at a time or adds comments from another part of the room, the microphone does not pick them up at all. This happens because the beamforming targets and focuses on the main speaker. During switching, it takes time for the beam to direct towards another speaker, cutting off words and comments. This means important information may get lost, and certain in-room participants might be excluded.</p>
<div class="video-popup-block type-p" id="video_popup_block_c9e8f01d86fd05de9ed6a44c3916b28f">

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Introducing the new Cisco Ceiling Microphone Pro</h2>
<p>The new Ceiling Microphone Pro isn&#8217;t just like any ceiling-mounted microphone. It is the <strong>first adaptive AI ceiling microphone</strong> on the market! Using advanced adaptive beamforming and audio processing, it captures crisp, natural sound and enables precise speaker tracking. Imagine having a microphone that adapts to changing meeting dynamics and workspace designs. Sounds amazing, right?</p>
<p>The microphone monitors the acoustic environment, follows the location and movement of voices in the meeting room, and directs the beams towards the active talker while rejecting other sounds from other parts of the room. By doing so, it’s way more efficient in suppressing noise, thus enabling better audio signal quality.</p>
<p>But beamforming is not a new technology. And here comes the twist. Let me share three reasons why this ceiling microphone is truly transformative and unlike any other solution available today.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Capturing multiple speakers’ voices</h2>
<p>Imagine that your team is pitching a new product concept and while the main presenter is speaking, the CEO adds a side comment—but it&#8217;s not captured by the microphone. Or while the beam focuses only on the main speaker, it rejects side comments and voice from the back of the room. It therefore fails to convey the voices of all participants and essential meeting context, failing to provide an inclusive experience on the far end.</p>
<p>Our team really wanted to solve this, so we built 64 microphone elements into Ceiling Microphone Pro powering eight adaptive beams that effectively capture voices of even multiple speakers at the same time. And capture side comments, reactions and alike to provide more context and clarity when people connect.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Adapting to meeting dynamics and design changes</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s say the team has a sync after talking to the CEO but the multi-purpose room they booked had been adapted to a customer session earlier in the day and Facilities had to rearrange the tables and seats. It’s not uncommon with a traditional ceiling microphone deployment that someone from IT or an AV technician must visit the room to verify and reconfigure the microphones to make sure that people within the adapted perimeters are still captured as expected.</p>
<p>Ceiling Microphone Pro is adaptive by design and doesn&#8217;t require retuning or recalibration in the above-mentioned scenario. And continues to seamlessly pick up voices even when someone leans backwards in the seat, stands up, moves around the table or approaches the front of room setup to present. Especially when it comes to flexible and multi-purpose spaces, it provides peace of mind that the microphone adapts to the meeting dynamics and room design changes—and not the other way around.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Spatial awareness for a better meeting experience</h2>
<p>And the third is the most special one. We’ve mentioned before how the Cisco codecs, cameras and microphones work together in the meeting room as an ecosystem to optimize the meeting experience in real time. Ceiling Microphone Pro monitors room activity and supports camera tracking and switching with audio triangulation. But that&#8217;s not all. For the first time in the industry, a conferencing microphone leverages rich positional and contextual data originating from the cameras to improve audio pickup accuracy and enable better speaker tracking.</p>
<p>What does that mean? In simple terms, it uses what the camera sees in the room and builds on this spatial awareness to know which parts of the meeting room it should focus on and which areas it should ignore.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-428839" height="1028" src="https://blog.webex.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/designer-ceiling-microphone.jpg" width="1672" /></figure>
<p>For instance, the room where the team sync takes place is equipped with a U-shaped table. Leveraging the camera head detection and advanced AI, the microphone will understand that it should not focus the beams on the middle section where no participant is located and becomes more efficient and dynamic in activating and directing the beams to the front of room when one member of the team approaches the front-of-room setup to present.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Setting up ceiling microphones has never been faster</h2>
<p>Now let&#8217;s have a look at the complexity of a microphone deployment.</p>
<p>Enabling proper audio coverage in the meeting room can be complex requiring third-party microphone solutions, external digital signal processor (DSP) units and a significant AV integration effort to make the conferencing components work together. These microphone solutions usually come with a separate management and design software, and lack a deep integration with the video conferencing equipment and cameras.</p>
<p>It happens very often that traditional solutions require technicians to manually tune and direct each beam. Now imagine the tedious process and associated cost to configure ceiling microphones across dozens or hundreds of meeting and learning spaces. Let alone the extensive site visits to reconfigure the audio system whenever a room layout changes.</p>
<p>When designing the Ceiling Microphone Pro, our vision was to dramatically simplify the audio setup and remove the need to use a patchwork of third-party tools for the audio deployment. To do so, our team developed a <strong>zero-touch, fully automated microphone calibration method</strong>. This means you just need to start the setup wizard on the Cisco Room Navigator touch controller and let the device do the rest. No matter if you have a single or multiple microphones connected to the video system, it maps the meeting space, understands the relative position of the microphones, and self-adjusts in minutes instead of hours. But don’t take my word for it, here’s a short demo showing you how it works:</p>
<div class="video-popup-block type-p" id="video_popup_block_e3a3ae0e6f9c2a9938429ab4df2a63b9">
<div class="we-video-container"><div class="popup-video popup-video-overlay"></div><div class="youtube_embed embed-video video-wrapper" id="youtube-embed-o2xL0Iy96HE"></div></div></div>
<p>By connecting over IP, it provides single-cable convenience when installing the microphone and provides a seamless way of extending your audio deployment with an Ethernet switch (like the <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/switches/catalyst-1200-series-switches/nb-06-cat1200-ser-data-sheet-cte-en.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Cisco Catalyst 1200 Series</a> PoE switches). In fact, you can connect up to eight Ceiling Microphone Pros to a Cisco video system (except the Cisco Room Bar that supports one IP microphone) allowing you to cover the largest of spaces and the most complex training room, auditorium, and divisible room scenarios.</p>
<p>Your AV team can finally forget about the external DSP box. This microphone features embedded digital signal processing and leverages the intelligence of connected Cisco video devices. This translates to simpler installation, fewer points of failure, and less complexity for ongoing support. And with unified cloud device management and diagnostics in Control Hub, continuous software upgrades, and secure AES-128 audio encryption, you can reduce the manageability and risk challenge inherent in conventional audio deployments while protecting the value of your collaboration technology investment.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-428799" height="1028" src="https://blog.webex.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/performance-ceiling-microphone.jpg" width="1672" /></figure>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Sustainability, Inevitable</h2>
<p>And of course, we shouldn&#8217;t forget about sustainability. As the first product to launch utilizing our new design language, Inevitable, sustainability was a primary focus in the design and engineering process of the Cisco Ceiling Mic Pro.</p>
<p>We’ve significantly reduced the amount of plastic in the product, using aluminum to manufacture the outer shell. That allows us to use highly recycled material and makes it easily recyclable when it reaches the end of its lifecycle. The top enclosure of the microphone doubles as the passive heat sink of the device, and its speaker grille is structural. And its modular design allows for easy assembly, disassembly, repair, and recycling. An AV technician needs only a single screwdriver for total disassembly, significantly reducing the effort for maintenance. We even emboss the screw head size on the top surface (unseen while installed) for convenience.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-428809" height="1028" src="https://blog.webex.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/parts-ceiling-microphone.jpg" width="1672" /></figure>
<p>Throughout our engineering process, we’ve achieved significant size and weight savings, which brings additional benefits in the form of smaller and lighter packaging— we&#8217;re saving 5 liters of space in the box compared to our initial concept. Aligned with our circular design goals, the packaging is not only lightweight but also 100% foam and plastic-free and fully recyclable.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Flexible to suit any workspace</h2>
<p>We designed the Ceiling Microphone Pro to blend seamlessly into various workspace environments. It&#8217;s discreet yet powerful, making it a perfect addition to modern meeting rooms and adaptable layouts. With flexible mounting options, soft, organic shapes, and crisp lines for precision, it supports a clean look and feel, whether in medium meeting rooms or large, divisible spaces.</p>
<p>This unobtrusive device offers excellent, tamper-free coverage for everyday meeting rooms. Plus, you can automatically combine multiple Ceiling Mic Pros to scale and provide an outstanding acoustic experience in large rooms, flexible workspaces, and multi-purpose scenarios.</p>
<p>Are you ready to revolutionize your meeting room audio experience with the Cisco Ceiling Microphone Pro?</p>

<title>Delivering Enhanced Video Experiences – Part 1</title>
<link>https://blog.webex.com/collaboration/delivering-enhanced-video-experiences/</link>
<guid>https://blog.webex.com/collaboration/delivering-enhanced-video-experiences/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Over the past few years, the use of collaboration tools has significantly increased, and video meetings have become essential to keeping us connected. With the new way of working, we often spend hours in meetings everyday and video quality plays an important role in the way we collaborate and interact with each other across different locations.</p>
<p>Here at Webex, we continue to focus on creating exceptional experiences for all by delivering high-quality media to improve communication, and ensuring that you can see and be seen, no matter how or where you are working from.</p>
<p>Webex is known for providing exceptional audio and video and has been at the forefront of driving better quality, 10x experiences, for years. Whether it be with improvements in <a href="https://www.webex.com/us/en/devices/cameras.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">camera technology</a><strong> </strong>to ensure the best video in any conditions, the use of AI to enhance <a href="https://blog.webex.com/hybrid-work/announcing-the-availability-of-industry-first-webex-ai-codec-transforming-your-audio-experiences/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">audio</a> or <a href="https://blog.webex.com/engineering/the-av1-video-codec-comes-to-webex/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">AV1</a> to deliver better quality at a given bandwidth, we continue to focus on ways to deliver the best experiences for our customers.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">New video enhancements for improved collaboration experience</h2>
<p>We never stop innovating and are always looking for ways to meet your evolving needs and improve your work efficiency, so that you can get more done. I am excited to share that we are increasing the sharpness of our video streams as well as delivering higher resolution video. Users can now see participants clearer than ever.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-428646" height="1028" src="https://blog.webex.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/new-video-enhancements.jpg" width="1672" /></figure>
<p>For example, when content is being shared during the meeting, you see meeting participants as small individual videos above the content. Although the overall experience of the content and multiple participants is in high resolution, the video for each participant was 90p (160 x 90) in 70% of meetings.&nbsp; We are now using the native resolution of the screen rather than what the operating system has defined, which is often lower, to decide the actual video resolution we send.</p>
<p>With our recent changes we are seeing that the use of 90p has decreased significantly and has been superseded by 180p (320 x 180). That means each participant experiencing 4x the quality compared to previous releases, resulting in seeing facial expressions more clearly, reducing meeting fatigue, and making the meeting more effective.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-428676" height="1028" src="https://blog.webex.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/video-pixel-90-180.jpg" width="1672" /></figure>
<p>This improvement isn’t just for 90p or for when content is being shared. We have seen a general increase in the resolution in multiple scenarios. Where we compose a layout from multiple video streams 180p is being used instead of 90p, 360p (640 x 360) is being used instead of 180p. That’s a 4x increase in pixels per participant. A 4x improvement in video quality.</p>
<p>Although the change to using the screen’s native resolution has already improved many users video quality, you could increase the quality further. As you increase the size of the Webex app on your screen there will be more pixels to render video upon and the potential for even higher resolution, even better quality.</p>
<p>Another enhancement is our down sampling pipeline. Webex captures participants’ video at high resolution but the resolution used for display depends on multiple factors.</p>
<p>If content is being shared during the meeting or multiple participants are being displayed, there is less space for video so a lower resolution can be more appropriate. The process of starting with high resolution video and adjusting based on meeting conditions is referred to as down sampling. We have enhanced our down sampling pipeline so that the video is sharper after it has been down sampled than in previous releases.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-428656" height="1028" src="https://blog.webex.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/experience-enhanced.jpg" width="1672" /></figure>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Experience enhanced video experience</h2>
<p>Both of these improvements are enabled automatically in Webex and require no additional action from you.</p>
<p>Video continues to be one of the most important aspects of collaboration and contributes significantly to providing the best experience for employees and customers. With our latest enhancements, we can deliver remarkable video quality, everywhere, on any device.  If you are ready to supercharge your experience, or would like to learn more, I encourage you or  <a href="https://use.webex.com/contact-sales?lang=en" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">reach out to our Sales team</a>  to discuss your specific needs.</p>

<title>How Cisco Phones enhance safety with emergency alert systems</title>
<link>https://blog.webex.com/workspaces/how-cisco-phones-enhance-safety-with-emergency-alert-systems/</link>
<guid>https://blog.webex.com/workspaces/how-cisco-phones-enhance-safety-with-emergency-alert-systems/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The importance of public safety has been steadily growing. With the rise of workers returning to the office and children going back to school, it’s critical that everyone feels safe in their environments. Schools and businesses are now turning to technology as one means to help in improving and implementing facility security and safety protocols.</p>
<p>While there are many technological solutions available, one that is gaining a lot of attention is emergency notification alerts and communication systems. These are put in place to help prevent incidents and improve response times in the case of emergencies. In fact, some states are now requiring schools to install panic alarm systems that are directly linked to law enforcement to help improve the safety of their campuses.</p>
<p>Whether it’s mandated or just recommended, now is the time to assess the current state of your facility&#8217;s security and emergency notification systems to ensure spaces are ready and plans are in place. The first place to start is your communications systems, such as phones and calling solutions, to make sure they have the safety features you need.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Adapting our phones to change.</h2>
<p>Cisco understands the importance of these public safety initiatives and has focused on integrating emergency response solutions seamlessly into the <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collaboration-endpoints/ip-phones/index.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Cisco Desk Phones</a> and <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collaboration-endpoints/webex-wireless-phone/index.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Wireless Phones</a>. We are the first in the industry to design our phones with an “action button” that can be quickly and easily activated in the case of an emergency. The button was created based on feedback from customers needing a streamlined way to access certain protocols like quick dialing, shortcuts, or, in this case, emergencies.</p>
<p>The action button is specifically designed to meet a variety of needs within buildings, including the ability to support safety protocols. See it in action below:</p>
<div class="video-popup-block type-p" id="video_popup_block_582775233e52508998e5569b529bb96b">
<div class="we-video-container"><div class="popup-video popup-video-overlay"></div><div class="brightcove_embed embed-video video-wrapper" id="brightcove-embed-6348989993112"></div></div></div>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How does the action button support public safety?</h2>
<p>The action button offers a wide range of use cases across industries, resulting in a simple solution for businesses to solve problems with a device that they already have at their desk or in their pocket. Here are some key use cases:</p>
<p><strong>Emergency notifications</strong></p>
<p>You can press the button to immediately trigger an emergency alert, which will send a digital notification to all nearby Cisco devices. This system can be used for evacuation and fire notifications, as well as emergency calls for help. It can seamlessly integrate with an emergency response or notification system.</p>
<p><strong>Silent panic alarm</strong></p>
<p>There are times when you may not want to trigger an emergency broadcast but still need to discreetly signal for help. In such cases, you can set your device to make a silent emergency call or send a discreet notification. For instance, this feature can be useful during emergency lockdowns or when there is an intruder in the building. This supports the compliance of Alyssa’s Law, which aims to ensure prompt responses to critical events.</p>
<p><strong>Security</strong></p>
<p>Many facilities have their own protocols for handling issues, commonly starting with a call to security to assess the situation. The action button can be a shortcut to call the onsite security team.</p>
<p>All 3 of these use cases can also be integrated into broader crisis management and facility security plans. While this is important for financial, healthcare, and retail purposes, education is increasingly being discussed as a use case for building safety, especially with the recent focus on Alyssa&#8217;s Law.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is Alyssa’s Law?</h2>
<p><a href="https://makeourschoolssafe.org/alyssas-law/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Alyssa’s law</a> is legislation that addresses the issue of law enforcement response time in life-threatening emergencies, recognizing that time is crucial in saving lives. The law requires the installation of silent panic alarms in K-12 schools, which are directly linked to law enforcement, to ensure a quick response in case of an emergency.</p>
<p>As of now, seven states in the U.S.—Florida, New Jersey, New York, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, and Utah—have enacted Alyssa’s Law. Additionally, 11 other states are in the process of ratifying this important legislation.</p>
<p>The law requirements of how to comply with this Alyssa’s Law vary from state to state. <a href="https://makeourschoolssafe.org/alyssas-law/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Learn more here.</a></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Cisco Phones support Alyssa’s Law.</h2>
<p>Cisco Desk Phones and <a href="https://www.webex.com/us/en/devices/phone-series/cisco-wireless-phone.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Wireless Phones</a> support customer’s compliance with Alyssa’s law by providing the functionality to quickly make an emergency call or access a silent panic alarm in a scalable, cost-effective way.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-426692" height="1846" src="https://blog.webex.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/d-rear.png" width="4500" /></figure>
<p>The <a href="https://www.webex.com/us/en/devices/phone-series/cisco-phone-9800-series.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Cisco Desk Phone 9800</a> offers direct capabilities that will activate a silent <strong>call </strong>during an emergency using CUCM or Webex Calling. The solution can also be further expanded when partnering with other companies, such as Singlewire, to activate a silent panic <strong>alarm</strong> during an emergency.</p>

<title>Cisco AI Assistant for Webex – New Features and Integrations</title>
<link>https://blog.webex.com/collaboration/cisco-ai-assistant-for-webex-new-features-and-integrations/</link>
<guid>https://blog.webex.com/collaboration/cisco-ai-assistant-for-webex-new-features-and-integrations/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The world of workplace collaboration is evolving rapidly, and Webex is at the forefront of this transformation. As businesses embrace modern work, the need for smart, secure, and efficient collaboration tools is more essential than ever. <a href="https://www.webex.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Webex</a> is meeting this demand with powerful AI innovations that streamline communication, boost productivity, and enhance user experience.&nbsp; Here’s a look at the <a href="https://www.webex.ai/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">latest advancements</a> we introduced at <a href="https://www.webexone.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">WebexOne</a> and how they’re shaping the future of collaborative work.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Intelligent Speaker Identification in Meetings</h2>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-428537" height="1028" src="https://blog.webex.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/intelligent-speaker-identification-version-two.jpg" width="1672" /></figure>
<p>At Webex we believe in the power of individuals and their need to be heard. Conference room participation is challenging for transcripts and summaries. Traditionally only the room name is available and the resulting transcript accuracy of who is speaking in a room is low. Leveraging the power of AI, Webex identifies speakers in a meeting sharing a conference room/ space.&nbsp; Using audio intelligence, each speaker is identified, ensuring every voice is heard and dramatically improves the accuracy and quality of the summaries.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">AI Assistant for Webex Calling</h2>
<div class="video-popup-block type-p" id="video_popup_block_23f7866b5a469818fbe3db2a282c0c07">
<div class="we-video-container"><div class="popup-video popup-video-overlay"></div><div class="youtube_embed embed-video video-wrapper" id="youtube-embed-6Nq8e_6IBs8"></div></div></div>
<p>Webex is integrating AI Assistant throughout the calling workflow. <a href="https://www.webex.com/products/webex-calling.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Webex Calling</a> users can view call summaries, action items during a live call or after a call.&nbsp; When a user transfers a call they can forward a summary to the new recipient, helping the new person get up to speed faster with the details of the call being forwarded to them so they can better help the person on the call. AI Assistant for Calling features will be rolled out in 2024 and 2025.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">AI Assistant for Cisco Devices</h2>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-428435" height="1028" src="https://blog.webex.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/AI-Assistant-Cisco-Devices.jpg" width="1672" /></figure>
<p>Combining the quality of <a href="https://www.webex.com/us/en/devices.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Cisco conference devices</a> and Cisco AI Assistant, we can now provide AI generated “catch-me up” summaries live during an in-person meeting to participants.&nbsp; AI Assistant for Cisco devices also provide users with any action items generated up to that point. These features allow participants joining an in-person meeting late to catch up and unify the experience with Webex meetings whose participants are all virtual.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">AI Generated Vidcast Presentations and Slido Polls</h2>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-428445" height="990" src="https://blog.webex.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ai-generated-vidcast.jpg" width="1672" /></figure>
<p>AI Assistant is democratizing engaging video for presentations. Simply upload a PowerPoint or PDF to <a href="https://www.vidcast.io/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Vidcast</a> and our AI will create a professional and engaging video with a complete talk track. With user controls for editing and tailoring your message. Users can define the tone, edit the script, choose multiple voice over options, all designed to tailor the presentation to a user’s needs. We also provide the capability to translate your presentation, increasing your reach globally.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-428527" height="1028" src="https://blog.webex.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/slido-polls-version2.jpg" width="1672" /></figure>
<p>Polls are a valuable way to gather feedback on presentations and drive engagement, but we don’t always have the time to design a poll ahead of time. <a href="https://www.webex.com/suite/polling.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Slido</a> AI-generated polls can now use AI to analyze a Microsoft PowerPoint or Google Slides and suggest polls tailored to your content, making it easier than ever to increase participant engagement.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Automate Workflows</h2>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-428455" height="1028" src="https://blog.webex.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/webex-ai-agent-oct30.jpg" width="1672" /></figure>
<p>Webex AI generated transcripts, summaries, and action items are a good start for AI productivity.&nbsp; They have replaced the time-consuming task of manual note taking.</p>
<p>We’ve heard our customers and are excited to provide the ability to share AI Assistant meetings content into Outlook, Copilot, Microsoft Teams and even Slack.&nbsp; Meeting summaries are a few clicks away from sharing with your colleagues via popular third-party apps.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-428547" height="1028" src="https://blog.webex.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/new-feature-kick-off-outlook-version-two.jpg" width="1672" /></figure>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">120+ Language Expansion for AI Assistant</h2>
<p>AI-generated summaries in meetings are now even more inclusive with language support expanding to 120+ languages. Additionally, Slido Q&amp;A and Vidcast generated videos now support translation in 75 languages with multiple options.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-428557" height="1028" src="https://blog.webex.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/new-feature-kick-off-version-two.jpg" width="1672" /></figure>

<title>Webex Integration Partners reimagine the power of AI at WebexOne 2024</title>
<link>https://blog.webex.com/innovation-ai/webex-integration-partners-reimagine-power-ai-webexone-2024/</link>
<guid>https://blog.webex.com/innovation-ai/webex-integration-partners-reimagine-power-ai-webexone-2024/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The spirit of the AI revolution was palpable at WebexOne 2024 in South Florida this week. Thousands of Cisco customers and partners gathered at the seaside Diplomat Beach Resort – and thousands more joined virtually – to explore how AI is shaping our collective future in exciting and novel ways.</p>
<p>You could find Webex Integration Partners in the middle of the action, working the floor, and running demos as they connected with customers, Cisco experts, and industry observers. Be sure to check out the happenings at the Webex partner booth, as well as fresh additions to the Webex App Hub, below.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Inspiring keynotes</h2>
<p>Jeetu Patel, Cisco’s Executive Vice President and Chief Product Officer, set the stage at this bustling event, describing the massive momentum behind AI that is driving a “seismic shift” in our industry and in our lives. As the AI revolution unfolds, expect a future that is “very agentic” – moving beyond just consuming information and automating tasks but changing workflows and reimagining jobs.</p>
<p>Cisco partners are helping reimagine both the customer and employee experience, Jeetu said. For example, every call that comes into a call center should not have call time, he said, “99% should be handled by a bot, but one that sounds like a human”. The crowd was later wowed by a demo of “Kate the AI Agent” running on Webex that was indistinguishable from a live person.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Next-gen workspaces</h2>
<p>That’s just one example of the many AI-driven innovations showcased at WebexOne that are engineered to elevate the customer and employee experience, remove distance, and create smart workplaces. Among these products were the <a href="https://www.webex.com/us/en/devices/accessories/cisco-ceiling-microphone-pro.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Cisco Ceiling Microphone Pro</a> to capture high-quality voice from multiple speakers, and <a href="https://www.webex.com/us/en/workspaces/workspace-designer.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Workspace Designer</a>, an interactive room configurator and design guide. AI is also built into <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/conferencing/webex-control-hub/at-a-glance-c45-744249.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Webex Control Hub</a> to quickly diagnose and take action to fix any communications or collaboration issues.</p>
<p>One of our top Webex partners took center stage at the event as Jeetu sat down with Apple’s Mike Rockwell, the creator of Apple Vision Pro. The two talked about <a href="https://blogs.cisco.com/news/how-cisco-is-using-apple-vision-pro-to-create-the-next-evolution-of-spatial-collaboration" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">how Cisco is using Apple Vision Pro to create the next evolution of spatial collaboration</a>. “Spatial imagery has a profound impact on you,” Mike said. “If you are calling remotely to a big conference room, the experience is astounding. It feels like you are there.”</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The big AI picture</h2>
<p>AI needs lots of data to thrive, according to Alexandr Wang, Founder and CEO of Scale AI, whose products powers advanced AI models. He joined Jeetu on stage to look at the barriers to unleashing AI potential – most notably data. The big picture for every enterprise, Alexandr told the audience is “figuring how you are going to harness your data to build something unique and only you can build.”</p>
<p>To cap off the first-day keynotes, Jeetu welcomed award-winning journalist Fareed Zakaria for an engaging fireside chat on global policy and how AI is revolutionizing the global landscape. Fareed noted that AI is still in its infancy, but like the computer and software revolution, it could take 10 years before we realize its productivity benefits. “I hope we find a way to use AI in a way that it can provide massive amounts of innovation in areas like technology and healthcare,” he said.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">WebexOne AI Hub</h2>
<p>New this year at WebexOne was the AI Hub, an interactive space where attendees engaged with Cisco’s latest AI and machine learning innovations alongside partner offerings. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/?nc2=h_lg" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">AWS</a> and <a href="https://scale.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Scale</a> showcased advanced AI models, <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Deloitte</a> and <a href="https://cloverhound.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Cloverhound</a> highlighted AI adoption strategies, <a href="https://www.glean.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Glean</a> and <a href="https://narada.ai/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Narada</a> displayed AI driven productivity solutions, <a href="https://aisera.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Aisera</a> and <a href="https://www.uniphore.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Uniphore</a> focused on customer experience and <a href="https://thriveglobal.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Thrive</a> showcased their agent wellness solutions.</p>

<p>At the booth, many customers inquired about the <a href="https://apphub.webex.com/applications/webex-telehealth-connector-for-epic" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Webex integration with Epic Healthcare</a>. Customers were eager to learn how Cisco is working with Epic Systems to complete a Toolbox designation for a Computer Telephony Integration (CTI) for Cheers CRM.&nbsp;This will enable healthcare providers to benefit from a streamlined, unified communication experience that significantly enhances patient engagement.</p>
<p>This CTI Toolbox designation complements Cisco’s existing integrations of Webex Connect and Instant Connect.

<title>Webex Go reimagined – more choice, flexibility, and coverage; ...</title>
<link>https://blog.webex.com/collaboration/webex-go-reimagined-more-choice-flexibility-and-coverage-zero-cost/</link>
<guid>https://blog.webex.com/collaboration/webex-go-reimagined-more-choice-flexibility-and-coverage-zero-cost/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>First unveiled at <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/webex-by-cisco-eliminates-the-need-to-carry-multiple-mobile-devices-for-business-and-personal-use-301403341.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">WebexOne 2021</a>, Webex Go is an innovative mobility solution that delivers a seamless, secure, compliant, and private calling experience for the modern workforce. Last week at <a href="https://www.webexone.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">WebexOne 2024</a>, we introduced new innovations that make Webex Go easier to deploy, more flexible, and more cost-effective for enterprises. The result? A game-changing mobile solution that empowers organizations to support workers of all types with flexible deployment and connectivity options.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Mobile calling for any workstyle</h2>
<p>Webex Go redefines mobile calling by offering flexible deployment options that fit any workstyle. It can be set up on either the primary or secondary line on most unlocked, eSIM-compatible devices, making it a versatile solution for today’s hybrid workforce. For corporate-issued devices, deploying Webex Go on the primary line is ideal, especially for executives or employees that handle sensitive business data. Meanwhile, for BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) models, employees can install Webex Go as a second line, allowing them to maintain privacy while staying connected professionally.</p>
<div class="video-popup-block type-p" id="video_popup_block_b78219ad17c5ab3905187b45f6ea190b">
<div class="we-video-container"><div class="popup-video popup-video-overlay"></div><div class="brightcove_embed embed-video video-wrapper" id="brightcove-embed-6346313948112"></div></div></div>
<p>Regardless of how it’s deployed, Webex Go maintains a single identity across the Webex ecosystem, managed centrally from <a href="https://www.webex.com/us/en/solutions/cross-platform/control-hub.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Webex Control Hub</a>. This unified approach not only simplifies management for IT but also delivers a consistent communication experience for users.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Webex Go is now included with Webex Calling</h2>
<p>Mobile calling isn’t just an option—it’s a necessity. That’s why we’re making Webex Go available at no additional cost with the Webex Calling Professional License. Previously, enabling Webex Go required separate SKUs, but that’s now history – just purchase the Webex Calling Professional License, select a calling plan from a Webex Go provider, and you’re ready to go! This crucial update makes it simpler for customers to integrate Webex Go into their communication strategy, delivering secure, compliant, and private mobile calls with ease. General availability is expected for late 2024 to early 2025.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">New, flexible connectivity options</h2>
<p>We’re making it easier than ever for enterprise to deploy Webex Go by expanding connectivity options to a new selection of Certified Mobile Calling Providers, including <a href="https://www.audiocodes.com/solutions-products/solutions/multi-ucaas-for-service-providers/audiocodes-mobile-connect" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">AudioCodes</a>, <a href="https://www.calltower.com/cisco-collaboration-solutions/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">CallTower</a>, <a href="https://www.pure-ip.com/webex" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">PureIP</a>, <a href="https://group.ntt/en/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">NTT</a>, <a href="https://nuwave.com/webex" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Nuwave</a>, and <a href="https://www.tatacommunications.com/solutions/unified-communications/unified-communications-as-a-service/ucaas-cisco-powered-solutions/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Tata Communications</a>. These providers have undergone rigorous testing to ensure reliable and high-quality enterprise mobile calling services. Services from Certified Mobile Calling Providers will roll out in late 2024 and into 2025, and complement our existing Mobile Operator partner <a href="https://www.business.att.com/products/att-cloud-voice-with-webex-go.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">AT&amp;T Business</a>.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-427775" height="955" src="https://blog.webex.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/flexible-connectivity-world-class-provider.jpg" width="1672" /></figure>

<title>The AI Revolution in Customer Experience is Now! Are you leading ...</title>
<link>https://blog.webex.com/collaboration/ai-revolution-in-customer-experience-leading-or-lagging-behind-competition/</link>
<guid>https://blog.webex.com/collaboration/ai-revolution-in-customer-experience-leading-or-lagging-behind-competition/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Customer experience solutions have skyrocketed to new heights, fueled by cutting-edge technology. The question is, will your organization ride this wave to emerge as an industry leader, or will you be left floundering in the wake of progress?</p>
<p>Even with advanced technology, customer satisfaction with the experience is stagnant. New technology has enabled efficiencies but has also created challenges like difficult-to-execute self-service experiences and overworked agents tasked with managing multi-channel experiences with little support. Even with better technology, customer satisfaction (CSAT) is declining rather than improving.</p>
<p>AI gives us the tools to manage increasingly complex customer journeys. It is a pivotal path forward for handling the growing number of channels customers prefer to communicate. It also gives organizations the ability to create more natural customer interactions. The real secret sauce is when self-service moves from being informational to actually being able to solve customer issues—which is made possible with service orchestration.</p>
<p>We wanted to learn more about the state of customer experience from the lens of the customer, agents, and the business. We <a href="https://www.webex.com/content/dam/www/us/en/documents/webexone/cx-research-maturity-model-infographic-cm-4669.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">surveyed</a> <strong>1,000 customer experience leaders</strong> across <strong>12 industries</strong> and <strong>10 markets</strong> and found a significant impact in three critical areas of impact: customers, agents, and the business.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Global Customer Experience Survey results</h2>
<p><strong>Customer Impact: 55% of Customers Avoid Self Service</strong></p>
<p>Virtual assistants and self-service are not new to the industry. We’ve had interactive voice recordings for a long time, which we’re all familiar with. These don’t do justice to what self-service can be.</p>
<p>According to our survey shows customers want to use self-service, but it’s not working for them. Our study found that <strong>55% of customers</strong> avoid self-service that feels rigid and unhelpful and <strong>63% of companies</strong> rely primarily on website FAQs to deliver self-service.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-427377" height="1028" src="https://blog.webex.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/red-stats.jpg" width="1672" /></figure>
<p><strong>Agent Impact: high attrition rates without access to AI enablement tools</strong></p>
<p>Agents lack the essential tools for effective support. A staggering <strong>1 in 3 agents</strong> report lacking the customer context needed to deliver an ideal customer experience. Organizations without access to AI tools report higher agent attrition rate than those implementing AI into the customer experience journey.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-427397" height="1028" src="https://blog.webex.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/green-stats.jpg" width="1672" /></figure>
<p><strong>Business Impact: 3 in 4 businesses have as many as 10 disparate customer data systems</strong></p>
<p>The inability to optimize technology and data significantly affects organizations. Of the businesses surveyed, <strong>75%</strong> have <strong>3</strong> or more siloed customer data systems, resulting in a <strong>48%</strong> longer resolution times for their customers, and <strong>50%</strong> lower CSAT.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-427387" height="1028" src="https://blog.webex.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/purple.jpg" width="1672" /></figure>
<p>The key difference between organizations seeing improvement to these long-standing challenges is their use and deployment of AI to support customers, agents, and the overall business.</p>
<p>Our findings pinpointed three critical metrics that are negatively impacting customers, agents, and businesses: 1) <strong>Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) is lagging</strong>, 2) <strong>Agent turnover is high</strong>, and 3) <strong>customer churn is increasing.</strong></p>
<p>These are significant challenges that have been hard to overcome. However, these are also the most significant areas of opportunity to improve customer experience with AI.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Introducing Webex AI Agent – the future of customer experience</h2>
<p>What if we could leverage generative AI and combine it with our expertise in conversational intelligence to make self-service feel human, helpful, and efficient? And, what if that self-service experience was so scalable, your customers find quick resolution to issues, your agents would no longer be overworked, and your CSAT scores skyrocket?</p>
<p>Now, it’s possible.</p>
<p>We call it the <strong><a href="https://www.webex.ai/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Webex AI agent</a></strong>.</p>
<p>It is a self-service concierge that combines conversational intelligence and generative AI to eliminate customer frustrations plaguing experience solutions. Not only can our AI Agent have natural-sounding conversations, but it can also pivot the conversation and follow along based on interruptions, corrections, or changes in subject. It’s as easy as talking to a friend.</p>
<p>The AI Agent also provides the intelligence and insights agents and businesses need to lead the AI game. It has back-office integration with popular applications that help organizations provide seamless experiences for an enormous variety of customer needs.</p>
<p>With this launch, we have left the days of old, robotic-sounding service bots behind and moved into a brighter future.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">AI Leaders vs. Laggards: What does it take to be an AI leader?</h2>
<p>Our survey used a maturity model approach across categories of Laggards, Followers, Pacesetters, and Leaders. We found common characteristics between organizations that experience lower customer satisfaction and higher agent attrition and, alternatively, those that experience the opposite.</p>
<p>What is driving this gap between organizations that deliver optimal customer experience and those that do not?</p>
<p>We found that <strong>76% of organizations</strong> that use AI have seen tangible business results that have positioned them as leaders in customer experience—and the AI divide between leaders and laggards only continues to grow.</p>
<p>Based on our results, those leading in customer experience with AI are implementing it across the customer journey and are seeing significant improvement in key metrics.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-427407" height="1028" src="https://blog.webex.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/cx-leaders-1.jpg" width="1672" /></figure>
<p><strong>Customer impact</strong></p>
<p>AI-driven self-service solutions are more human, proactive, and effective.</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Leaders saw CSAT scores improve by <strong>92%</strong> with AI self-service, compared to AI laggards with less than <strong>50%</strong> improvement.</li>
<li><strong>61%</strong> of leaders use AI proactive outreach, while only <strong>6% </strong>of laggards deployed the same.</li>
<li><strong>84%</strong> of AI leaders used AI to reduce hold times, while AI laggards saw no reduction.</li>
</ul>
<p>The impact on overall customer satisfaction and net promoter scores (NPS) between leaders and laggards was stark.</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>AI leaders saw customer satisfaction scores with extremely satisfied ratings of <strong>70%</strong>, with laggards having only <strong>2% </strong>of customers with the same rating.</li>
<li>NPS for laggards was <strong>43</strong>. In comparison, AI leaders saw an NPS of <strong>70.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Agent impact</strong></p>
<p>Real-time workflow automation and orchestration with AI significantly enhances agent performance. As AI Assistant adoption grows, we are seeing promising impacts on both speed to resolution and Agent engagement.</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>73%</strong> of agents with AI assistance in AI leader organizations compared to only <strong>10%</strong> of AI laggards.</li>
<li>Agent workloads have decreased in organizations that have deployed and adopted AI. By comparison, workloads without widespread AI adoption have increased by <strong>56%</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The results are stark.</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Agent efficiency is <strong>68%</strong> for AI leaders and less than <strong>1% </strong>in organizations that have not adopted AI.</li>
<li><strong>24% </strong>of leading organizations are providing AI assistance to augment agent capabilities and experience.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Business impact</strong></p>
<p>With AI designed into every aspect of customer experience solutions with our AI Agent, it’s easy to integrate disparate back-end systems, like CRMs, that contain critical data and create workflows that pull information into the contact center for resolution.</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>42%</strong> of leader organizations and <strong>55%</strong> of laggard organizations had <strong>4</strong> or less disparate data systems</li>
<li><strong>70% </strong>of leaders and only <strong>46% </strong>of laggards are using cloud based contact centers</li>
<li><strong>69% </strong>of leaders are leveraging CPaaS (Communications Platform as a Service) for communication orchestration, while only <strong>23%</strong> of laggards are doing the same</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The impact on business includes:</strong></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>85% </strong>improvement in customer churn for leaders and only <strong>30%</strong> for laggards.</li>
<li><strong>65%</strong> of leaders cited a significant increase in revenue with AI usage. Less than 1% of laggards reported a revenue increase.</li>
</ul>
<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />
<p>The goal of our AI solutions is to empower people with the breadth and depth of experience that AI can provide to add to the richness of the human experience. Our Webex AI Agent is doing just that, taking customer experience to the next level.</p>

<title>The Next Evolution of Distance Zero: New Devices and Experiences ...</title>
<link>https://blog.webex.com/collaboration/next-evolution-new-devices-experiences-with-cisco-and-apple-vision-pro/</link>
<guid>https://blog.webex.com/collaboration/next-evolution-new-devices-experiences-with-cisco-and-apple-vision-pro/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Last year, we set a vision: <a href="https://blog.webex.com/workspaces/be-in-the-room-from-anywhere/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Distance Zero</a>; collaboration that makes it feel like there is no distance between you and your colleagues, regardless of how or where you choose to connect. You can sit anywhere in the world, and still experience the creativity, productivity, and innovation that <a href="https://www.webex.com/us/en/solutions/return-to-office.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">thrives at the office</a>. Since then, we’ve delivered hardware and software experiences with purpose-built audio and video intelligence that make it feel like you’re in the room, even if you’re joining a meeting from thousands of miles away.</p>
<p>Today, we are excited to unveil the evolution of Distance Zero with the <a href="https://newsroom.cisco.com/c/r/newsroom/en/us/a/y2024/m10/cisco-unveils-new-ai-innovations-to-amplify-the-employee-experience-and-future-proof-the-workplace.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">launch</a> of new devices and features:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Cisco Spatial Meetings for Apple Vision Pro</li>
<li>Cisco Ceiling Microphone Pro – the industry’s first AI adaptive ceiling microphone</li>
<li>Simplify IT management with the all-new Smart Diagnostics in Control Hub&nbsp;</li>
<li>Deploy Distance Zero experiences faster with Cisco’s new Workspace Designer</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Introducing Cisco Spatial Meetings for Apple Vision Pro.</h2>
<div class="video-popup-block type-p" id="video_popup_block_017a6183b60b05d871861e35f5c3d081">
<div class="we-video-container"><div class="popup-video popup-video-overlay"></div><div class="brightcove_embed embed-video video-wrapper" id="brightcove-embed-6363593442112"></div></div></div>
<p>Leveraging your existing equipment, customers can turn any space equipped with a <a href="https://www.webex.com/us/en/devices/room-series/cisco-room-bar-pro.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Cisco Room Bar Pro</a> into a spatial video studio. That’s 28,000 devices already in the market, that are now ready to deploy a stereoscopic video environment. That’s thousands of customers, who just need to go update their software and get a Vision Pro, and their conference rooms are ready for spatial video – in 4K resolution and true-to-color.</p>
<p>This is what we mean when we say Cisco technology is future-proofed.&nbsp; We’ve built devices that are ready for tomorrow’s collaboration experiences. We built a network that supports the bandwidth of tomorrow’s experiences. And we built a security portfolio that ensures the experience is protected. We are agile and we are ready for the future of innovation.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-426724" height="427" src="https://blog.webex.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/spatial-meeting-meaningful.png" width="711" /></figure>
<p>Spatial meetings have meaningful implications for businesses, particularly in the realm of design, instruction, and remote inspection. Why? Stereoscopic video significantly amplifies the experience of examining physical objects by including depth and dimension Imagine, reviewing intricate design decisions in true to color, crystal clear precision to better understand shades, hues or material choice. In a past role, I can imagine having reduced decision-making time by half if I’d been able to see the difference in various shades&#8230;</p>
<p>Let me give you an example of how we might use this technology on my team. Let’s say that you and I are designing an industry-first, adaptive AI ceiling microphone. I’m in San Jose, and you’re sitting on the other side of the world, in Oslo, Norway. If I hold up the microphone prototype to a Room Bar Pro, we could look together in stereoscopic video at its single connection point and discuss how audio over IP makes the device simple to deploy.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-426741" height="427" src="https://blog.webex.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/aiceiling-microphone.jpg" width="711" /></figure>
<p>If I break the device open, together in stereoscopic video, we could examine how 64 microphones enable adaptive beamforming in any space. I could show you three small speakers that release white noise to automatically calibrate with other devices in the room, so that working together, they know exactly where the speaker is in the room at any given moment.</p>
<p>That’s why <a href="https://www.webex.com/us/en/solutions/integrations/apple.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Cisco Spatial Meetings and Apple Vision Pro</a> are so incredible together. We can see the object, up close, in 4K and true colors, from anywhere in the world with remarkable depth and dimension. We can innovate together, learn together, experience together.</p>
<p>We’ve heard from customers that this technology has the potential to accelerate learning for remote students through immersive instruction. Spatial video can allow them to step into new worlds, effectively bringing the distance between professors and students down to zero.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“At H-FARM, we believe Spatial Meetings will transform both in-classroom learning and supercharge our online programs. The exceptional high-fidelity, true-to-color 3D immersive experiences will enable us to create dynamic and interactive learning spaces, where physical distance becomes irrelevant, and student engagement reaches unprecedented levels.”&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Riccardo Donadon, Founder &amp; CEO &#8211; H-Farm</cite></blockquote>
<p>And, with Cisco AI Assistant for Webex now available on Apple Vision Pro, users can improve productivity with AI-enhanced capabilities to catch up on meetings, get summaries, writing assistance, and more.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-426771" height="900" src="https://blog.webex.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/apple-visiin-pro-v2.jpg" width="1500" /></figure>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Immersive audio, simple to deploy in any workspace: Introducing the Cisco Ceiling Microphone Pro</h2>
<p>Basic camera and audio solutions are insufficient for today’s needs of the workforce. Nearly half of employees feel that meeting spaces aren’t effective because of AV issues. For these interactions to be as good as in-person, all participants need to be seen and heard clearly. Since the foundation of great video starts with great audio, our solutions are built to give voice to every person in the meeting room, and to put an end to the question: “can you move closer to the microphone?” Every participant can enter any workspace, sit down, and seamlessly be seen and heard clearly.</p>
<p>Today, we are so excited to announce the evolution of Distance Zero audio: immersive audio in any workspace with the <a href="https://www.webex.com/us/en/devices/accessories/cisco-ceiling-microphone-pro.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Cisco Ceiling Microphone Pro</a>. It’s an AI-powered ceiling microphone with adaptive beamforming; it leverages built-in processing, combined with the intelligence of Cisco cameras and devices to enable immersive audio in workspaces of all shapes and sizes. Leveraging the intelligence of our Cisco devices, the microphone&nbsp;understands meeting dynamics and changes in room design, adapting to the changes without any need for reconfiguration.</p>
<div class="video-popup-block type-p" id="video_popup_block_97edc0e94245ac557bd0783f296c1f3d">
<div class="we-video-container"><div class="popup-video popup-video-overlay"></div><div class="brightcove_embed embed-video video-wrapper" id="brightcove-embed-6363354422112"></div></div></div>
<p>Of course, these experiences are only possible if our customers can deploy them at scale. To make Distance Zero a reality in the hands of our customers, we’ve made a habit of making them simple to deploy. The Ceiling Microphone Pro is truly plug and play, with one audio over IP connection point. While traditional ceiling microphones require manual tuning, trial-and-error placement, and tedious camera tracking integration, the Microphone Pro communicates with and configures itself to the cameras in the room– deploying immersive audio in a matter of minutes. It’s a dramatic simplification for IT teams, so that <em>every</em> room across a global environment can be deployed with Distance Zero audio.</p>
<p>Like with our full portfolio of devices, Ceiling Microphone Pro can be centrally managed in Control Hub, alongside the room system, cameras, displays and other peripherals &#8211; eliminating the need for a dedicated 3rd party management tool, a simplified management experience for IT.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Empowering Cisco’s IT users: Introducing the all-new Smart Diagnostics in Control Hub</h2>
<p>At Cisco, we have two key users we’re innovating for: the first is the people in the room, using the devices and applications. Our second user is the organization and team that is running our service.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.webex.com/workspaces/the-new-workplace-powered-by-ai-and-collaboration-devices/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">We develop technology for both</a>; that’s one of the ways Cisco has a unique offering in the market. As it turns out, we know a thing or three about networking and security. We understand the IT experience. So, the same AI assistant leveraged across the Cisco ecosystem is also available for Webex: a one-stop shop for IT with a simple user interface.</p>
<p>This year, we announced a step further in AI for IT, with the industry’s <a href="https://blog.webex.com/workspaces/industry-first-ai-for-workspaces/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">first AI-powered Workspace Ranking</a>. By listing workspaces that require attention in order of urgency, IT teams can differentiate minor problems from significant fire drills. With it, we’re making it even easier for admins to identify, prioritize, and resolve issues proactively – before they become a fire drill.</p>

This choice allowed Yale to retain most of their endpoints while providing flexible calling services regardless of location or device.

<p>The Royal Bank of Canada (RBC), the largest bank in Canada, serves over 16 million clients with a global workforce of approximately 89,000 employees. Before using Webex, RBC faced several business challenges, including the need to improve client experience and security for SMS-based communication of critical messages.

They enabled a Branded Text add-on to reach clients over Rich Communication Services (RCS) on Android devices, along with SMS where device is not RCS capable. RBC forecasts 20 million messages will be sent per month, comprising of a mix of SMS and Rich Communication Services (RCS), 24% of which is expected to be delivered as RCS by using Branded Text.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Crédit Agricole&#8217;s integration of the Webex Meeting API into their retail banking app empowers 25,000 advisors to connect directly with clients, significantly enhancing customer service and user experience. This move led to an 100% increase in customer appointments over the last six months, boosting customer satisfaction, loyalty, and business growth. Additionally, the transition of 80,000 lines to the cloud with Webex Calling will modernize their communications infrastructure, ensuring scalability and future-proofing. This strategic shift is expected to improve joinability, unify all Crédit Agricole Group entities under a unique platform and reduce telecom and operational costs by 20% over the next five years, driving operational efficiencies throughout the organization.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Webex Luminary | Jason O’Dell and Robert Bibey</h2>
<p>This award recognizes individuals in companies who are advocating for Webex and are visionaries in their organization, driving change by rallying others to embrace Webex.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-427548" height="1028" src="https://blog.webex.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/first-horizon-2024-winner.jpg" width="1672" /></figure>
<p>First Horizon Bank operates across 12 states with 750 agents, 5,500 employees, 20,000 endpoints, and over 1.1 million customers. To improve customer experience and operational efficiency, Jason made the decision to migrate the bank to <a href="https://www.webex.com/us/en/products/customer-experience/contact-center.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Webex Contact Center</a> in March 2021. This move allowed the bank to streamline onboarding and training and quickly integrate 1,500 agents to handle increased customer interactions from recent mergers. The implementation of Webex has led to an 87% self-service rate, reducing the need for live agents and enabling them to focus on more complex issues. Jason also rolled out <a href="https://socio.events/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Webex Events</a>, <a href="https://www.webex.com/suite/meetings.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Webex Meetings</a>, and the <a href="https://www.webex.com/downloads.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Webex App</a> at First Horizon Bank to maintain connectivity and collaboration, especially during the pandemic. With another merger on the horizon, Jason continues to leverage Webex for seamless collaboration and expects it to remain central to the bank’s growth and success.</p>

<p>Burrell Behavioral Health, a division of Brightli, transformed its outdated call management system to <a href="https://www.webex.com/suite/enterprise-cloud-calling.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Webex Calling</a> and <a href="https://www.webex.com/us/en/products/customer-experience/contact-center.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Webex Contact Center</a> in 2021, leading to significant improvements in reliability and service. Leveraging Webex&#8217;s cloud-based solutions, Robert and the team at Burrell effectively support the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline, ensuring immediate and life-saving assistance with a 99% uptime rate. The transition allowed Robert to onboard agents rapidly and manage crisis workers efficiently, enhancing accessibility and responsiveness. Webex Control Hub&#8217;s analytics and reporting capabilities provide a centralized view, optimizing resource allocation to meet demand spikes. Looking ahead, Robert is working towards migrating three different platforms from recent acquisitions to Webex.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Over the past decade, Webex has been on a journey to improve how people communicate and collaborate. In this time, regardless of modality – messaging, voice, or video, synchronous or asynchronous – one constant has emerged: Experience Matters. Radically simple to articulate yet exceptionally complex to deliver, the very best experience is what we deliver across our portfolio: <a href="https://www.webex.com/suite/collaboration-suite.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Webex Suite</a>, <a href="https://www.webex.com/customer-experience.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Webex Customer Experience</a>, and <a href="https://www.webex.com/us/en/devices.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Cisco Collaboration Devices</a>.</p>
<p>The latest technology and most sophisticated algorithms are meaningless if they don&#8217;t enable you to share your best ideas and collaborate productively. Committed to delivering exceptional experiences, we are leveraging AI to reimagine collaboration among employees and communication with customers.</p>
<p>This year, we have intensified our focus on &#8220;Experience&#8221; by continuing to invest in AI to make interactions clearer, more immersive, more effective, and even more human. The next chapter of Webex is about Experience, Amplified.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A new era of customer experience with the AI Agent</strong></h2>
<p><br />We all know what a great customer experience feels like, but delivering great Customer Experience is something easier said than done. If it’s not thoughtfully applied, even the best technology can get in the way. For example, only <a href="https://www.webex.com/content/dam/www/us/en/documents/webexone/cx-research-maturity-model-infographic-cm-4669.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">25%</a> of customers were very satisfied with their last service engagement. This is why service technology, especially self-service, needs to evolve. Enter the <a href="https://blog.webex.com/customer-experience/revolutionizing-customer-experience-webex-ai-powered-innovations/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><strong>Webex AI Agent</strong></a>. These agents deliver a true self-service experience with natural, conversational language, as well as orchestration and automation for a complete user journey. Imagine voice interactions that sound and feel like conversing with a real person—thanks to the agent&#8217;s human-like intonation, language understanding, and ability to follow context within conversations. Digital interactions via texts or online chats are equally seamless and informed, making customers feel as though they have a personal concierge at their service. Powerful, out-of-the-box integrations with leading back-end systems mean end-customers can use the Webex AI Agent not only to get their questions answered, but also to fulfill actions for complete resolution of their issues. This is the most human-like virtual agent experience ever, leveraging AI to create genuine conversations tailored to your business with domain-specific data, transitioning smoothly between topics without losing context.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-427172" height="1028" src="https://blog.webex.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/sno-webex-ai-agent.jpg" width="1672" /></figure>
<p>Building these virtual agents couldn’t be easier, thanks to the <strong>Webex AI Agent Studio</strong>. With a simple step-by-step interface, contact center managers can create powerful virtual agents in minutes. With the super-human scale of the AI Agents, businesses can increase frontline capacity and offer 24/7 service without adding staffing. This will allow human agents to focus on more complex issues, improving both the self-service and agent-assisted experience.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-427182" height="1028" src="https://blog.webex.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/sno-ai-agent-studio.jpg" width="1672" /></figure>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>New ways to work with the AI Assistant</strong></h2>
<p>Webex AI Agents will revolutionize the self-service experience, but what about human agents? Agents and supervisors can take advantage of the <a href="https://www.webex.com/products/contact-center-AI.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><strong>AI Assistant for Webex Contact Center</strong></a>. Innovations like Topic Analytics and Automatic Customer Satisfaction Scores intelligently analyze large amounts of data to improve agent performance and to maximize customer satisfaction. Virtual agent and dropped call conversation summaries reduce knowledge gaps and improve resolution times when handoffs are made.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-427162" height="1028" src="https://blog.webex.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/sno-webex-contact-center.jpg" width="1672" /></figure>
<p><br />Thanks to our platform approach, the AI Assistant is available across our broader Webex portfolio including the Webex Suite. Today, I am excited to share how we continue to elevate the experience with <strong>the AI Assistant for Webex Calling.</strong>&nbsp;With <a href="https://www.webex.com/suite/enterprise-cloud-calling.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">calling</a> being one of the most vital ways to connect, we are thrilled to have AI built into this important workload for our 16 million plus calling users across 180+ markets globally. The AI Assistant leverages our audio intelligence innovations and powerful generative AI models to generate summaries, notes, and action items in real time during a call so users will never forget an important detail of a conversation. Call summaries and notes can also be shared when transferring a call, so recipients can quickly be caught up on the conversation.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-427122" height="1005" src="https://blog.webex.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/working-from-home-calling.jpg" width="1672" /></figure>
<p>Critical to amazing employee experiences is empowering everyone to feel like they are seen and heard. Now, the AI Assistant for Webex can translate AI summaries in over 120 languages to ensure language is no longer a barrier for communication and understanding. And for meetings where multiple people are gathered in the same room, the AI Assistant can recognize and label individual speakers in the transcript.</p>
<p>We will also soon be expanding the AI Assistant to give users the ability to:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Automate workflows through integrations with enterprise apps including Salesforce, ServiceNow, Zendesk, and more.</li>
<li>Integrate with Glean, enabling mutual customers to enhance discussions and speed up decision-making with its knowledge graph and connectors including Outlook, Salesforce, and ServiceNow.</li>
<li>Choose the Large Language Model (LLM) that best fits their needs with Amazon Bedrock.</li>
<li>Share summaries and recaps across third-party platforms including Microsoft Outlook, Teams, and Slack.</li>
</ul>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-427342" height="898" src="https://blog.webex.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/super-ai-exo-system-v3.jpg" width="1650" /></figure>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Next-level audience engagement</strong></h2>
<p>Collaboration tools need to be flexible to fit the rhythm of modern work. Vidcast, our video messaging tool, enables users to communicate in a more personal and engaging way. And thanks to the power of AI, we are enriching the viewing experience with automatic chapters and highlights and enhancing your content with AI-powered noise removal and immersive backgrounds. Soon, we will be taking it a step further with <strong>AI-generated Vidcast</strong>. Simply upload a PDF or PPT file and Vidcast will generate a talk track and even create a video with voice over.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-427142" height="1028" src="https://blog.webex.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/video-generation.jpg" width="1672" /></figure>
<p>Soon, we will also use AI to enhance audience participation by generating custom-made polls based on your presentation content. Slido’s new AI feature will seamlessly analyze your Microsoft PowerPoint or Google Slides and suggest polls tailored to your content with just one click, making it easier than ever to boost participant engagement.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-427242" height="1028" src="https://blog.webex.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/slido-ai-genrated-polls.jpg" width="1672" /></figure>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><br />True-to-life experiences with Cisco Devices</h2>
<p>Distance Zero is our vision for eliminating the sense of distance between people, giving every interaction an in-person feel. We’re delivering these experiences through our Cisco devices and Webex software using purpose-built AI for audio and video.&nbsp;Now we’re introducing an experience that lets our customers engage in a spatial video environment. <a href="https://blogs.cisco.com/news/how-cisco-is-using-apple-vision-pro-to-create-the-next-evolution-of-spatial-collaboration" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Cisco Spatial Meetings</a> enables Apple Vision Pro users to interact with others like they’re right there with them. Cisco uniquely delivers this, thanks to our AI-powered devices with NVIDIA chipsets and dual-lens cameras that can capture every nuance in a three-dimensional (3D) environment. It’s like turning any room with a Cisco Room Bar Pro into a 3D studio.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-427252" height="947" src="https://blog.webex.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/project-nevada.jpg" width="1672" /></figure>
<p>Today, we are also excited to introduce our latest intelligent device designed for meeting spaces, the <a href="https://blog.webex.com/innovation-ai/next-evolution-new-devices-experiences-with-cisco-and-apple-vision-pro/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><strong>Cisco Ceiling Mic Pro</strong></a>. This is the market’s first AI-powered ceiling microphone with adaptive beamforming &#8211; it recognizes the location of participants in the room, and automatically configures itself to capture the best audio. Of course, it is also incredibly easy to manage thanks to <a href="https://www.webex.com/us/en/solutions/cross-platform/control-hub.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Webex Control Hub</a>.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-427192" height="1028" src="https://blog.webex.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/celiling-microphone-pro.jpg" width="1672" /></figure>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Building smarter workspaces with Cisco</h2>
<p>The future office is no longer confined to a single building; it is a network of physical and digital spaces designed to enhance every aspect of work. The challenge is to integrate these spaces in a way that delivers an excellent end-user experience and allows IT to easily monitor and manage the environment. We are making it easier than ever for organizations to get started building smarter workplaces with <strong><a href="https://www.webex.com/us/en/workspaces/workspace-designer.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Workspace Designer</a></strong>. This free self-service tool provides recommendations for furniture, platform, and product choices and creates custom blueprints tailored to workspace needs.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-427132" height="946" src="https://blog.webex.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/work-space-designer.jpg" width="1672" /></figure>

<title>The AI Revolution in Customer Experience is Now! Are you leading ...</title>
<link>https://blog.webex.com/innovation-ai/ai-revolution-in-customer-experience-leading-or-lagging-behind-competition/</link>
<guid>https://blog.webex.com/innovation-ai/ai-revolution-in-customer-experience-leading-or-lagging-behind-competition/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Customer experience solutions have skyrocketed to new heights, fueled by cutting-edge technology. The question is, will your organization ride this wave to emerge as an industry leader, or will you be left floundering in the wake of progress?</p>
<p>Even with advanced technology, customer satisfaction with the experience is stagnant. New technology has enabled efficiencies but has also created challenges like difficult-to-execute self-service experiences and overworked agents tasked with managing multi-channel experiences with little support. Even with better technology, customer satisfaction (CSAT) is declining rather than improving.</p>
<p>AI gives us the tools to manage increasingly complex customer journeys. It is a pivotal path forward for handling the growing number of channels customers prefer to communicate. It also gives organizations the ability to create more natural customer interactions. The real secret sauce is when self-service moves from being informational to actually being able to solve customer issues—which is made possible with service orchestration.</p>
<p>We wanted to learn more about the state of customer experience from the lens of the customer, agents, and the business. We <a href="https://www.webex.com/content/dam/www/us/en/documents/webexone/cx-research-maturity-model-infographic-cm-4669.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">surveyed</a> <strong>1,000 customer experience leaders</strong> across <strong>12 industries</strong> and <strong>10 markets</strong> and found a significant impact in three critical areas of impact: customers, agents, and the business.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Global Customer Experience Survey results</h2>
<p><strong>Customer Impact: 55% of Customers Avoid Self Service</strong></p>
<p>Virtual assistants and self-service are not new to the industry. We’ve had interactive voice recordings for a long time, which we’re all familiar with. These don’t do justice to what self-service can be.</p>
<p>According to our survey shows customers want to use self-service, but it’s not working for them. Our study found that <strong>55% of customers</strong> avoid self-service that feels rigid and unhelpful and <strong>63% of companies</strong> rely primarily on website FAQs to deliver self-service.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-427377" height="1028" src="https://blog.webex.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/red-stats.jpg" width="1672" /></figure>
<p><strong>Agent Impact: high attrition rates without access to AI enablement tools</strong></p>
<p>Agents lack the essential tools for effective support. A staggering <strong>1 in 3 agents</strong> report lacking the customer context needed to deliver an ideal customer experience. Organizations without access to AI tools report higher agent attrition rate than those implementing AI into the customer experience journey.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-427397" height="1028" src="https://blog.webex.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/green-stats.jpg" width="1672" /></figure>
<p><strong>Business Impact: 3 in 4 businesses have as many as 10 disparate customer data systems</strong></p>
<p>The inability to optimize technology and data significantly affects organizations. Of the businesses surveyed, <strong>75%</strong> have <strong>3</strong> or more siloed customer data systems, resulting in a <strong>48%</strong> longer resolution times for their customers, and <strong>50%</strong> lower CSAT.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-427387" height="1028" src="https://blog.webex.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/purple.jpg" width="1672" /></figure>
<p>The key difference between organizations seeing improvement to these long-standing challenges is their use and deployment of AI to support customers, agents, and the overall business.</p>
<p>Our findings pinpointed three critical metrics that are negatively impacting customers, agents, and businesses: 1) <strong>Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) is lagging</strong>, 2) <strong>Agent turnover is high</strong>, and 3) <strong>customer churn is increasing.</strong></p>
<p>These are significant challenges that have been hard to overcome. However, these are also the most significant areas of opportunity to improve customer experience with AI.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Introducing Webex AI Agent – the future of customer experience</h2>
<p>What if we could leverage generative AI and combine it with our expertise in conversational intelligence to make self-service feel human, helpful, and efficient? And, what if that self-service experience was so scalable, your customers find quick resolution to issues, your agents would no longer be overworked, and your CSAT scores skyrocket?</p>
<p>Now, it’s possible.</p>
<p>We call it the <strong><a href="https://www.webex.ai/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Webex AI agent</a></strong>.</p>
<p>It is a self-service concierge that combines conversational intelligence and generative AI to eliminate customer frustrations plaguing experience solutions. Not only can our AI Agent have natural-sounding conversations, but it can also pivot the conversation and follow along based on interruptions, corrections, or changes in subject. It’s as easy as talking to a friend.</p>
<p>The AI Agent also provides the intelligence and insights agents and businesses need to lead the AI game. It has back-office integration with popular applications that help organizations provide seamless experiences for an enormous variety of customer needs.</p>
<p>With this launch, we have left the days of old, robotic-sounding service bots behind and moved into a brighter future.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">AI Leaders vs. Laggards: What does it take to be an AI leader?</h2>
<p>Our survey used a maturity model approach across categories of Laggards, Followers, Pacesetters, and Leaders. We found common characteristics between organizations that experience lower customer satisfaction and higher agent attrition and, alternatively, those that experience the opposite.</p>
<p>What is driving this gap between organizations that deliver optimal customer experience and those that do not?</p>
<p>We found that <strong>76% of organizations</strong> that use AI have seen tangible business results that have positioned them as leaders in customer experience—and the AI divide between leaders and laggards only continues to grow.</p>
<p>Based on our results, those leading in customer experience with AI are implementing it across the customer journey and are seeing significant improvement in key metrics.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-427407" height="1028" src="https://blog.webex.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/cx-leaders-1.jpg" width="1672" /></figure>
<p><strong>Customer impact</strong></p>
<p>AI-driven self-service solutions are more human, proactive, and effective.</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Leaders saw CSAT scores improve by <strong>92%</strong> with AI self-service, compared to AI laggards with less than <strong>50%</strong> improvement.</li>
<li><strong>61%</strong> of leaders use AI proactive outreach, while only <strong>6% </strong>of laggards deployed the same.</li>
<li><strong>84%</strong> of AI leaders used AI to reduce hold times, while AI laggards saw no reduction.</li>
</ul>
<p>The impact on overall customer satisfaction and net promoter scores (NPS) between leaders and laggards was stark.</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>AI leaders saw customer satisfaction scores with extremely satisfied ratings of <strong>70%</strong>, with laggards having only <strong>2% </strong>of customers with the same rating.</li>
<li>NPS for laggards was <strong>43</strong>. In comparison, AI leaders saw an NPS of <strong>70.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Agent impact</strong></p>
<p>Real-time workflow automation and orchestration with AI significantly enhances agent performance. As AI Assistant adoption grows, we are seeing promising impacts on both speed to resolution and Agent engagement.</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>73%</strong> of agents with AI assistance in AI leader organizations compared to only <strong>10%</strong> of AI laggards.</li>
<li>Agent workloads have decreased in organizations that have deployed and adopted AI. By comparison, workloads without widespread AI adoption have increased by <strong>56%</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The results are stark.</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Agent efficiency is <strong>68%</strong> for AI leaders and less than <strong>1% </strong>in organizations that have not adopted AI.</li>
<li><strong>24% </strong>of leading organizations are providing AI assistance to augment agent capabilities and experience.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Business impact</strong></p>
<p>With AI designed into every aspect of customer experience solutions with our AI Agent, it’s easy to integrate disparate back-end systems, like CRMs, that contain critical data and create workflows that pull information into the contact center for resolution.</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>42%</strong> of leader organizations and <strong>55%</strong> of laggard organizations had <strong>4</strong> or less disparate data systems</li>
<li><strong>70% </strong>of leaders and only <strong>46% </strong>of laggards are using cloud based contact centers</li>
<li><strong>69% </strong>of leaders are leveraging CPaaS (Communications Platform as a Service) for communication orchestration, while only <strong>23%</strong> of laggards are doing the same</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The impact on business includes:</strong></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>85% </strong>improvement in customer churn for leaders and only <strong>30%</strong> for laggards.</li>
<li><strong>65%</strong> of leaders cited a significant increase in revenue with AI usage. Less than 1% of laggards reported a revenue increase.</li>
</ul>
<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />
<p>The goal of our AI solutions is to empower people with the breadth and depth of experience that AI can provide to add to the richness of the human experience. Our Webex AI Agent is doing just that, taking customer experience to the next level.</p>

<link>https://blog.webex.com/innovation-ai/next-evolution-new-devices-experiences-with-cisco-and-apple-vision-pro/</link>
<guid>https://blog.webex.com/innovation-ai/next-evolution-new-devices-experiences-with-cisco-and-apple-vision-pro/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Last year, we set a vision: <a href="https://blog.webex.com/workspaces/be-in-the-room-from-anywhere/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Distance Zero</a>; collaboration that makes it feel like there is no distance between you and your colleagues, regardless of how or where you choose to connect. You can sit anywhere in the world, and still experience the creativity, productivity, and innovation that <a href="https://www.webex.com/us/en/solutions/return-to-office.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">thrives at the office</a>. Since then, we’ve delivered hardware and software experiences with purpose-built audio and video intelligence that make it feel like you’re in the room, even if you’re joining a meeting from thousands of miles away.</p>
<p>Today, we are excited to unveil the evolution of Distance Zero with the <a href="https://newsroom.cisco.com/c/r/newsroom/en/us/a/y2024/m10/cisco-unveils-new-ai-innovations-to-amplify-the-employee-experience-and-future-proof-the-workplace.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">launch</a> of new devices and features:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Cisco Spatial Meetings for Apple Vision Pro</li>
<li>Cisco Ceiling Microphone Pro – the industry’s first AI adaptive ceiling microphone</li>
<li>Simplify IT management with the all-new Smart Diagnostics in Control Hub&nbsp;</li>
<li>Deploy Distance Zero experiences faster with Cisco’s new Workspace Designer</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Introducing Cisco Spatial Meetings for Apple Vision Pro.</h2>
<div class="video-popup-block type-p" id="video_popup_block_017a6183b60b05d871861e35f5c3d081">
<div class="we-video-container"><div class="popup-video popup-video-overlay"></div><div class="brightcove_embed embed-video video-wrapper" id="brightcove-embed-6363593442112"></div></div></div>
<p>Leveraging your existing equipment, customers can turn any space equipped with a <a href="https://www.webex.com/us/en/devices/room-series/cisco-room-bar-pro.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Cisco Room Bar Pro</a> into a spatial video studio. That’s 28,000 devices already in the market, that are now ready to deploy a stereoscopic video environment. That’s thousands of customers, who just need to go update their software and get a Vision Pro, and their conference rooms are ready for spatial video – in 4K resolution and true-to-color.</p>
<p>This is what we mean when we say Cisco technology is future-proofed.&nbsp; We’ve built devices that are ready for tomorrow’s collaboration experiences. We built a network that supports the bandwidth of tomorrow’s experiences. And we built a security portfolio that ensures the experience is protected. We are agile and we are ready for the future of innovation.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-426724" height="427" src="https://blog.webex.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/spatial-meeting-meaningful.png" width="711" /></figure>
<p>Spatial meetings have meaningful implications for businesses, particularly in the realm of design, instruction, and remote inspection. Why? Stereoscopic video significantly amplifies the experience of examining physical objects by including depth and dimension Imagine, reviewing intricate design decisions in true to color, crystal clear precision to better understand shades, hues or material choice. In a past role, I can imagine having reduced decision-making time by half if I’d been able to see the difference in various shades&#8230;</p>
<p>Let me give you an example of how we might use this technology on my team. Let’s say that you and I are designing an industry-first, adaptive AI ceiling microphone. I’m in San Jose, and you’re sitting on the other side of the world, in Oslo, Norway. If I hold up the microphone prototype to a Room Bar Pro, we could look together in stereoscopic video at its single connection point and discuss how audio over IP makes the device simple to deploy.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-426741" height="427" src="https://blog.webex.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/aiceiling-microphone.jpg" width="711" /></figure>
<p>If I break the device open, together in stereoscopic video, we could examine how 64 microphones enable adaptive beamforming in any space. I could show you three small speakers that release white noise to automatically calibrate with other devices in the room, so that working together, they know exactly where the speaker is in the room at any given moment.</p>
<p>That’s why <a href="https://www.webex.com/us/en/solutions/integrations/apple.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Cisco Spatial Meetings and Apple Vision Pro</a> are so incredible together. We can see the object, up close, in 4K and true colors, from anywhere in the world with remarkable depth and dimension. We can innovate together, learn together, experience together.</p>
<p>We’ve heard from customers that this technology has the potential to accelerate learning for remote students through immersive instruction. Spatial video can allow them to step into new worlds, effectively bringing the distance between professors and students down to zero.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“At H-FARM, we believe Spatial Meetings will transform both in-classroom learning and supercharge our online programs. The exceptional high-fidelity, true-to-color 3D immersive experiences will enable us to create dynamic and interactive learning spaces, where physical distance becomes irrelevant, and student engagement reaches unprecedented levels.”&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Riccardo Donadon, Founder &amp; CEO &#8211; H-Farm</cite></blockquote>
<p>And, with Cisco AI Assistant for Webex now available on Apple Vision Pro, users can improve productivity with AI-enhanced capabilities to catch up on meetings, get summaries, writing assistance, and more.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-426771" height="900" src="https://blog.webex.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/apple-visiin-pro-v2.jpg" width="1500" /></figure>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Immersive audio, simple to deploy in any workspace: Introducing the Cisco Ceiling Microphone Pro</h2>
<p>Basic camera and audio solutions are insufficient for today’s needs of the workforce. Nearly half of employees feel that meeting spaces aren’t effective because of AV issues. For these interactions to be as good as in-person, all participants need to be seen and heard clearly. Since the foundation of great video starts with great audio, our solutions are built to give voice to every person in the meeting room, and to put an end to the question: “can you move closer to the microphone?” Every participant can enter any workspace, sit down, and seamlessly be seen and heard clearly.</p>
<p>Today, we are so excited to announce the evolution of Distance Zero audio: immersive audio in any workspace with the <a href="https://www.webex.com/us/en/devices/accessories/cisco-ceiling-microphone-pro.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Cisco Ceiling Microphone Pro</a>. It’s an AI-powered ceiling microphone with adaptive beamforming; it leverages built-in processing, combined with the intelligence of Cisco cameras and devices to enable immersive audio in workspaces of all shapes and sizes. Leveraging the intelligence of our Cisco devices, the microphone&nbsp;understands meeting dynamics and changes in room design, adapting to the changes without any need for reconfiguration.</p>
<div class="video-popup-block type-p" id="video_popup_block_97edc0e94245ac557bd0783f296c1f3d">
<div class="we-video-container"><div class="popup-video popup-video-overlay"></div><div class="brightcove_embed embed-video video-wrapper" id="brightcove-embed-6363354422112"></div></div></div>
<p>Of course, these experiences are only possible if our customers can deploy them at scale. To make Distance Zero a reality in the hands of our customers, we’ve made a habit of making them simple to deploy. The Ceiling Microphone Pro is truly plug and play, with one audio over IP connection point. While traditional ceiling microphones require manual tuning, trial-and-error placement, and tedious camera tracking integration, the Microphone Pro communicates with and configures itself to the cameras in the room– deploying immersive audio in a matter of minutes. It’s a dramatic simplification for IT teams, so that <em>every</em> room across a global environment can be deployed with Distance Zero audio.</p>
<p>Like with our full portfolio of devices, Ceiling Microphone Pro can be centrally managed in Control Hub, alongside the room system, cameras, displays and other peripherals &#8211; eliminating the need for a dedicated 3rd party management tool, a simplified management experience for IT.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Empowering Cisco’s IT users: Introducing the all-new Smart Diagnostics in Control Hub</h2>
<p>At Cisco, we have two key users we’re innovating for: the first is the people in the room, using the devices and applications. Our second user is the organization and team that is running our service.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.webex.com/workspaces/the-new-workplace-powered-by-ai-and-collaboration-devices/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">We develop technology for both</a>; that’s one of the ways Cisco has a unique offering in the market. As it turns out, we know a thing or three about networking and security. We understand the IT experience. So, the same AI assistant leveraged across the Cisco ecosystem is also available for Webex: a one-stop shop for IT with a simple user interface.</p>
<p>This year, we announced a step further in AI for IT, with the industry’s <a href="https://blog.webex.com/workspaces/industry-first-ai-for-workspaces/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">first AI-powered Workspace Ranking</a>. By listing workspaces that require attention in order of urgency, IT teams can differentiate minor problems from significant fire drills. With it, we’re making it even easier for admins to identify, prioritize, and resolve issues proactively – before they become a fire drill.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-426781" height="1175" src="https://blog.webex.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/smart-diagnostics-v2.jpg" width="2088" /></figure>
<p>Today, we’re excited to take simplicity a step further, with the all-new Smart Diagnostics in Control Hub. Not only will Control Hub identify issues and make recommendations regarding which to solve first– powerful AI will now analyze the issue, draw up internal and external documentation, and suggest actions to resolve the issue for one or multiple devices. With just one click, Admin can resolve an issue occurring in 10 workspaces in under 10 seconds.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Design Distance Zero workspaces faster with the new Workspace Designer tool</h2>
<p>I mentioned we’ve made a habit of building experiences that are simple to deploy. We know that designing reimagined spaces takes a careful consideration of technology, and reviews from various stakeholders in IT, Facilities, and even HR. After <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/m/en_uk/solutions/hybrid-work/workplace-solutions/penn1-lookbook.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">reimagining our offices at Penn1</a> and worldwide, we consolidated our learnings into repeatable blueprints. We’re excited to unveil the next iteration of that, with the new <a href="https://www.webex.com/us/en/workspaces/workspace-designer.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Workspace Designer tool</a>.</p>
<div class="video-popup-block type-p" id="video_popup_block_1e6787000eda2c26d8e7a3141f1817a7">
<div class="we-video-container"><div class="popup-video popup-video-overlay"></div><div class="brightcove_embed embed-video video-wrapper" id="brightcove-embed-6363442216112"></div></div></div>
<p>Inspired by our global offices’ modernization, the tool leverages Cisco&#8217;s experience in collaboration and technology to help you choose the right tools easily. Leveraging your customized dimensions or recommendations from Cisco, you can dynamically adjust table arrangements, number of seats, meeting platforms, and more. Like having a Cisco expert in your back pocket, the tool will make recommendations around audio coverage, screen visibility, and more.&nbsp; With expert tips and recommendations, it guides you to create great collaboration spaces, avoid costly mistakes, and speed up workplace transformation.</p>

<title>How Cisco Phones enhance safety with emergency alert systems</title>
<link>https://blog.webex.com/customer-experience/how-cisco-phones-enhance-safety-with-emergency-alert-systems/</link>
<guid>https://blog.webex.com/customer-experience/how-cisco-phones-enhance-safety-with-emergency-alert-systems/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The importance of public safety has been steadily growing. With the rise of workers returning to the office and children going back to school, it’s critical that everyone feels safe in their environments. Schools and businesses are now turning to technology as one means to help in improving and implementing facility security and safety protocols.</p>
<p>While there are many technological solutions available, one that is gaining a lot of attention is emergency notification alerts and communication systems. These are put in place to help prevent incidents and improve response times in the case of emergencies. In fact, some states are now requiring schools to install panic alarm systems that are directly linked to law enforcement to help improve the safety of their campuses.</p>
<p>Whether it’s mandated or just recommended, now is the time to assess the current state of your facility&#8217;s security and emergency notification systems to ensure spaces are ready and plans are in place. The first place to start is your communications systems, such as phones and calling solutions, to make sure they have the safety features you need.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Adapting our phones to change.</h2>
<p>Cisco understands the importance of these public safety initiatives and has focused on integrating emergency response solutions seamlessly into the <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collaboration-endpoints/ip-phones/index.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Cisco Desk Phones</a> and <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collaboration-endpoints/webex-wireless-phone/index.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Wireless Phones</a>. We are the first in the industry to design our phones with an “action button” that can be quickly and easily activated in the case of an emergency. The button was created based on feedback from customers needing a streamlined way to access certain protocols like quick dialing, shortcuts, or, in this case, emergencies.</p>
<p>The action button is specifically designed to meet a variety of needs within buildings, including the ability to support safety protocols. See it in action below:</p>
<div class="video-popup-block type-p" id="video_popup_block_582775233e52508998e5569b529bb96b">
<div class="we-video-container"><div class="popup-video popup-video-overlay"></div><div class="brightcove_embed embed-video video-wrapper" id="brightcove-embed-6348989993112"></div></div></div>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How does the action button support public safety?</h2>
<p>The action button offers a wide range of use cases across industries, resulting in a simple solution for businesses to solve problems with a device that they already have at their desk or in their pocket. Here are some key use cases:</p>
<p><strong>Emergency notifications</strong></p>
<p>You can press the button to immediately trigger an emergency alert, which will send a digital notification to all nearby Cisco devices. This system can be used for evacuation and fire notifications, as well as emergency calls for help. It can seamlessly integrate with an emergency response or notification system.</p>
<p><strong>Silent panic alarm</strong></p>
<p>There are times when you may not want to trigger an emergency broadcast but still need to discreetly signal for help. In such cases, you can set your device to make a silent emergency call or send a discreet notification. For instance, this feature can be useful during emergency lockdowns or when there is an intruder in the building. This supports the compliance of Alyssa’s Law, which aims to ensure prompt responses to critical events.</p>
<p><strong>Security</strong></p>
<p>Many facilities have their own protocols for handling issues, commonly starting with a call to security to assess the situation. The action button can be a shortcut to call the onsite security team.</p>
<p>All 3 of these use cases can also be integrated into broader crisis management and facility security plans. While this is important for financial, healthcare, and retail purposes, education is increasingly being discussed as a use case for building safety, especially with the recent focus on Alyssa&#8217;s Law.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is Alyssa’s Law?</h2>
<p><a href="https://makeourschoolssafe.org/alyssas-law/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Alyssa’s law</a> is legislation that addresses the issue of law enforcement response time in life-threatening emergencies, recognizing that time is crucial in saving lives. The law requires the installation of silent panic alarms in K-12 schools, which are directly linked to law enforcement, to ensure a quick response in case of an emergency.</p>
<p>As of now, seven states in the U.S.—Florida, New Jersey, New York, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, and Utah—have enacted Alyssa’s Law. Additionally, 11 other states are in the process of ratifying this important legislation.</p>
<p>The law requirements of how to comply with this Alyssa’s Law vary from state to state. <a href="https://makeourschoolssafe.org/alyssas-law/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Learn more here.</a></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Cisco Phones support Alyssa’s Law.</h2>
<p>Cisco Desk Phones and <a href="https://www.webex.com/us/en/devices/phone-series/cisco-wireless-phone.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Wireless Phones</a> support customer’s compliance with Alyssa’s law by providing the functionality to quickly make an emergency call or access a silent panic alarm in a scalable, cost-effective way.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-426692" height="1846" src="https://blog.webex.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/d-rear.png" width="4500" /></figure>
<p>The <a href="https://www.webex.com/us/en/devices/phone-series/cisco-phone-9800-series.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Cisco Desk Phone 9800</a> offers direct capabilities that will activate a silent <strong>call </strong>during an emergency using CUCM or Webex Calling. The solution can also be further expanded when partnering with other companies, such as Singlewire, to activate a silent panic <strong>alarm</strong> during an emergency.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>We are incredibly proud to announce that Gartner has recognized <strong>Cisco as a Leader in the 2024 Gartner Magic Quadrant for our Unified Communications as a Service (UCaaS) offerings</strong> for the <strong>6<sup>th</sup> consecutive year</strong>! We believe our positioning is a result of our unwavering vision and proven ability to execute. We are truly honored by this recognition.</p>
<p>At our core, Webex has always been about connecting people. As work has evolved, we’ve been ahead of the curve at investing in AI, tightly integrating collaboration hardware and software, and building a breadth of Unified Communications as a Service (UCaaS), Contact Center as a Service (CCaaS), and Communications Platform as a Service (CPaaS) capabilities. Our vision is to help even the world’s largest companies deliver a successful cloud transformation, and we are inspired by the possibilities ahead.</p>
<p>For us, this recognition is a testament to our team&#8217;s hard work, innovation, and commitment, and it signals the momentum we’ve built in reshaping the future of communications. We are one of the only two vendors recognized in three Magic Quadrant reports for CCaaS, CPaaS, and UCaaS.</p>
<p>Cisco was named <a href="https://cpaas.webex.com/blog/2024-gartner-magic-quadrant-for-cpaas" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="">a Visionary in the 2024 Gartner Magic Quadrant<img alt="™" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2122.png" style="height: 1em;" /> for Communications Platform as a Service (CPaaS),</a> and a Niche Player for <a href="https://blog.webex.com/customer-experience/gartner-contact-center-mq-2023/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="">Webex Contact Center in the 2023 Gartner Magic Quadrant<img alt="™" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2122.png" style="height: 1em;" /> for Contact Center as a Service (CCaaS<strong>)</strong>.</a></p>
<p><strong>We believe these three areas are core to our continued acknowledgement:</strong></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Our significant AI investments</strong> <strong>across the entire UCaaS portfolio</strong> are a testament to our commitment to innovation. These investments are not just about increasing employee productivity within Meetings, Messaging, Calling, Devices, and the Webex Suite, but also about delivering significant efficiency in Contact Center. They are a key factor in our continued success.</li>
<li><strong>Introducing the latest generation of hardware endpoints.</strong> The 9800 series desk phones, headsets, cameras, meeting room kits, and collaboration boards make in-person and virtual collaboration feel like everyone is in the same room. The desk phones include a new design, AI features, power management, and a programmable action button for emergencies.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>The breadth of our offerings exceeds our UCaaS competitors.</strong> Our unified communications capabilities include back-end calling, messaging, meetings, contact center, CPaaS, observability services, hardware endpoints, room meeting systems, and gateways.</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep reading to find out more about how we create exceptional experiences in these areas.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Forward-thinking investments in AI across our entire portfolio</h2>
<p>We’ve purposefully built and invested in AI to deploy it across our entire portfolio, enabling unparalleled ease of use and effectiveness across Webex Contact Center, Webex Meetings, Messaging, Calling, Devices, and administrative portals in Control Hub.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-style-default"><img alt="" class="wp-image-426490" height="775" src="https://blog.webex.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ai-assitant-latest-october-gartner.jpg" width="1961" /></figure>
<p>Doing so has redefined what’s possible by delivering more innovative, faster, and more intuitive employee and customer experiences. From automating complex processes and enhancing customer journeys to providing actionable intelligence about Devices or office spaces, Cisco AI Assistant works effortlessly across hardware and software to deliver seamless experiences that don’t just help our customers innovate but make their lives and work easier.</p>
<div>

</div>
<p><strong>In the last year, we’ve delivered incredible AI momentum, including:</strong></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>40 new AI capabilities, including our flagship Cisco AI Assistant for Webex that helps employees, contact center agents, IT, and developers be more productive, proactive, and focused.</li>
<li>Best Collaboration Display &#8211; UC Today</li>
<li>The new Webex AI Codec, an industry-first application of advanced neural networks and machine learning to speech that significantly improves the hybrid work experience in lossy network situations, is generally available.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://www.tmcnet.com/topics/articles/2024/02/21/458741-tmc-announces-2023-generative-ai-product-the-year.htm" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">TMC 2023 Generative AI Product of the Year</a> award for the Cisco AI Assistant for Webex Contact Center&nbsp;</li>

<title>The cloud resurgence: How AI and Webex solutions are driving a ...</title>
<link>https://blog.webex.com/customer-experience/cloud-resurgence-how-ai-webex-solutions-driving-new-wave-deployments/</link>
<guid>https://blog.webex.com/customer-experience/cloud-resurgence-how-ai-webex-solutions-driving-new-wave-deployments/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>You&#8217;ve likely seen countless articles about moving contact centers to the cloud. And you might be wondering, &#8220;Will this one offer anything new?&#8221;</p>
<p>Stick around, and I&#8217;ll show you why it&#8217;s worth your time.</p>
<p>The cloud era is evolving with the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), which thrives on data and excels in cloud environments. AI is driving automation, helping businesses innovate and modernize their customer experience strategy.</p>
<p>If you manage a contact center, you understand the importance of balancing cost, efficiency, and customer satisfaction. AI makes this balance achievable.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why cloud is THE only way forward</h2>
<p>There’s more to investing in cloud and AI than meets the eye. First, if you’re running on legacy on-premises technology, you simply can’t innovate. You can try, but it will be painful, expensive, IT resource intensive, and slow &#8211; very slow.</p>
<p>When we think about innovation, AI is usually the first technology that comes to mind. But AI requires data and leveraging data becomes almost impossible with an on-premises system because it lacks the flexibility to integrate data from different sources. It’s unable to efficiently handle data aggregation, analysis, and prediction – all of which are crucial to a successful AI strategy.</p>
<p>On the other hand, AI is built into just about every piece of cloud software today, including CCaaS or contact center-as-a-service.</p>
<p>Secondly, you can’t digitize. Digital transformation isn’t just a buzzword – it’s a necessity in today’s world and another key reason why businesses are investing in the cloud. Consumers are tech-savvy, and they expect companies to take a digital-first approach to customer experience (CX). Research by <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Business%20Functions/Operations/Our%20Insights/The%20care%20of%20one%20Hyperpersonalization%20of%20customer%20care/The-care-of-one-Hyperpersonalization-of-customer-care.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">McKinsey &amp; Company </a>revealed that more than half of customers engage with three to five channels during each journey they take toward making a purchase or resolving a request. The challenge for contact centers lies in providing a set of seamlessly integrated digital channels that meet the needs of your most important revenue-generating, value-generating customer requests.</p>
<p>Which brings me to my third point. How do you know what your customers want, and which interactions are your most profitable ones? The answer is AI-driven data insights.</p>
<p>When combined with AI, data analytics provides a powerful tool to enhance how contact centers engage with their customers proactively and preemptively. AI can reveal insights hidden within your data, providing a deeper understanding of your customers and allowing you to optimize operations and resources for maximum efficiency.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">AI and cloud – a match made for innovation</h2>
<p>AI&#8217;s rapid development is deeply tied to the cloud, and Generative AI (GenAI) is further amplifying its relevance and importance. A cloud platform is truly optimal for providing the computing power, speed, scalability, and data storage necessary for advanced AI technologies to thrive. According to <a href="https://www.aberdeen.com/blog-posts/video-research-meets-reality-what-drives-cx-business-leaders-to-invest-in-ai-part-i/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Aberdeen Research</a>, 80% of companies are turning to AI to harness the potential of their existing data to drive enhanced customer experiences and impactful business outcomes.</p>
<p>AI enables businesses to engage with customers before they even reach out by predicting their needs and proactively delivering information, offering solutions, or helping resolve issues ahead of time.</p>
<p>Nowhere is customer data more accessible than in the contact center. AI and data are being used to create proactive communications outreach and hyper-personalized customer experiences that drive repeat business and increase brand loyalty. Let me give you a few examples.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Scenario 1: Unlock your edge with insights</h3>
<p>Ever wonder how to quickly discover what your customers are talking about when they engage with your call center? The solution is AI. By analyzing customer conversations, AI can identify recurring themes and provide your business with valuable insights that help improve customer experiences, enhance agent training, and uncover potential product or process issues. For example, if your contact center receives an unusually high volume of inquiries about a particular product, this trend alerts your teams that there might be market shifts or issues with your website or virtual agent.</p>
<p>Research by <a href="https://gitnux.org/business-automation-statistics/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Gitnux</a> indicates that 84% of executives report that AI will enable them to obtain or sustain a competitive advantage. Acting on these insights allows you to make targeted improvements that can not only reduce call volume, increase sales, and lower customer effort, but can also boost your competitive advantage.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Scenario 2: Laser-focused routing – every time</h3>
<p>When a customer or prospect is reaching your contact center, it’s crucial to get it right the first time. Meaning, you need to route them to the right resource that is most qualified to help them in the quickest, most efficient way. Based on what channel the customer is using, be it chat, email, or voice, and the reason for their query, AI can determine which inquiries can be handled by a virtual agent and which ones will be longer and more complex in nature and likely require assistance from a customer service agent.</p>
<p>AI can also analyze customer history, previous buying patterns, and behavior to predict future behaviors and their potential lifetime value. With this insight, AI can route your customers to specific teams or customer service agents with the right skills, delivering a “just in time” personalized experience and driving a more predictable, profitable business outcome.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Scenario 3: Increase customer satisfaction – before it’s too late</h3>
<p>When it comes to CSAT scores, we understand the importance of having insights into both your highest and lowest ratings to continuously improve and prevent customer churn. That’s why we’ve developed automatic customer satisfaction (CSAT) scores.</p>
<p>Leveraging our native AI capabilities, this feature predicts post-interaction CSAT scores, allowing contact centers to tap into data from every interaction instead of just the typical 3-10% response rate from post-interaction surveys.</p>
<p>This advanced capability within Webex Contact Center analyzes call recordings and other crucial interaction elements like sentiment, tone of voice, hold times, and transcripts – factors often overlooked by survey responses, and provides valuable information about how your customers feel about your brand. These insights empower your business to understand both what’s working and what’s not, enabling you to take proactive steps to enhance the customer experience.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><br />The absence of automation can impact agent wellbeing</h2>
<p>Let’s circle back to my earlier point about automation. Automation leads to increased efficiency and productivity levels. The push for greater efficiency is yet another reason businesses are investing in cloud and AI.</p>
<p>According to research by Gitnux, contact center agents spend 37% of their time doing unproductive work, which leads to burnout. Indeed, agents spend a great deal of their time performing repetitive and time-consuming tasks while juggling various systems and applications before, during, and after customer interactions, which, if not automated, can be challenging.</p>
<p>AI can generate automated wrap-up summaries that include suggested follow-up actions and wrap-up codes for each customer interaction. This saves time for agents while providing the business with a clearer picture of interaction data</p>
<p>AI can also use data to proactively minimize agent stress levels. Imagine having AI automatically schedule breaks when it detects potential stress for agents. For instance, if an agent has handled multiple back-to-back lengthy calls with upset customers, AI can re-route upcoming calls to other agents or switch the stressed agent to a less demanding digital channel, minimizing burnout and allowing the agent some time to reset.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Here&#8217;s what you just learned in 5 minutes</h2>
<p>AI innovation is best leveraged with modern cloud deployments. As senior <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/emilsayegh/2023/08/23/artificial-intelligence-and-clouds-a-complex-relationship-of-collaboration-and-concern/?sh=28e283a95c19" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Forbes</a> contributor Emil Sayegh puts it: “The cloud provides us with a canvas of scalability, adaptability, and cost-efficiency, and serves as a foundation upon which the full gamut of AI’s capabilities can flourish.”</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t let the limitations of your legacy on-premises contact center technology determine the quality, completeness, and ease of experiences you deliver to customers or employees.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re ready to prioritize cloud transformation and future-proof your contact center, explore <a href="https://www.webex.com/us/en/products/customer-experience/contact-center.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Webex Contact Center</a> &#8211; the AI-powered customer experience platform for today and tomorrow.</p>

The <a href="http://www.webex.ai/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><strong>Cisco AI Assistant for Webex</strong></a> plays a key role in bolstering productivity and improving communications.</p>
<p>Organizations leveraging these advanced AI features are witnessing significant improvements in meeting effectiveness and enhanced wellbeing for both remote and hybrid employees.</p>
<p>Employees increased productivity, saving valuable time throughout the day, allowing&nbsp; them to focus on high-priority tasks:</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-423043" src="https://blog.webex.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/3.jpg" /></figure>

<p>With Webex AI, there are benefits for every workstyle. For instance, Sebastian Leuser, Solution Architect at Deutsche Telekom, shared his thoughts on his favorite Webex AI feature:</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="heading3"><br />AI powers intelligent office experiences</h2>
<p>As many employees return to the office for at least a few days a week, traditional office setups are proving ill-equipped to support modern hybrid work. The role of the office has evolved from a mandatory place to work to a destination where employees engage in collaboration, ideation, training, and community building. However, with the rise of hybrid work, not everyone will be in the office at the same time, and only <strong><a href="https://www.webex.com/gp/hybrid-work-research-global-2024.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="">42% of employees</a></strong> believe their office is prepared to support hybrid work.</p>
<p>To create an immersive experience that makes everyone feel like an equal participant, workspaces need collaboration devices equipped with AI-driven audio and video intelligence. Cisco devices, with NVIDIA technology built in, are providing cutting-edge collaboration experiences, effectively bridging the gap between in-office teams and remote colleagues.</p>
<p>AI-powered collaboration devices have proven instrumental in boosting meeting effectiveness:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>81% reported significantly more effective meetings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>80% cited increased productivity, presentation quality, and collaboration abilities.&nbsp;</li>
<li>71% of remote workers felt a greater sense of inclusion during hybrid meetings.&nbsp;</li>
<li>86% experienced a significant reduction in fatigue and enhanced focus during meetings involving remote, in-room, or on-the-go participants.</li>
</ul>
<p>Niklas Mortensen, Managing Direct at Designit, sees the effect of AI-powered devices firsthand: “Collaboration across studios has become much more of a thing. It was not that we didn’t do it before, but now, borders don’t really matter anymore, because we can all collaborate and work remotely, and clients also see this.”</p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.webex.ai/ai-assistant-for-suite-devices-cx.html?tab=tab-devices" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><strong>audio and video intelligence</strong></a> built into each device, Cisco devices can help transform the workplace experience by bringing AI-powered capabilities to every workspace.<br /><br /></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="heading4"><br />Security and manageability in the era of AI</h2>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The IT experience</strong></h3>
<p>We&#8217;re thrilled to witness how Webex customers are utilizing AI Assistant to enhance hybrid work and deliver innovative customer experiences, but what can it do for the teams responsible for evaluating and implementing solutions and troubleshooting issues?</p>
<p>When it comes to IT, there are also substantial time savings: 73% of IT Admins expect to save up to 8 hours a week through AI-powered search. By embedding AI into Control Hub, the single-pane-of-glass management platform, IT can spend less time troubleshooting and problem-solving and focus on the more strategic role of improving the experience for every employee.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Security you can trust</strong></h3>
<p>We also know that every organization has concerns when it comes to implementing AI. According to a <a href="https://www.webex.com/gp/dimensional-research-hybrid-work-AI-research-2024.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><strong>recent research report</strong></a> by Dimensional Research, the top concern is security.</p>
<p>At Cisco, we recognize the critical importance of AI governance and the responsible implementation of AI technologies. AI Assistant meets industry-leading security standards, ensuring end-to-end, secure AI solutions for our customers. For more details, please visit <a href="https://trustportal.cisco.com/c/r/ctp/home.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=""><strong>Cisco’s Trust Portal</strong></a>.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="heading5">Conclusion</h2>
<p>These results demonstrate that AI is not just living up to the hype; it&#8217;s transforming the way we work and interact. By seamlessly integrating AI into every interaction, we are enabling organizations to achieve unprecedented levels of productivity, collaboration, and customer satisfaction.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="heading3"><br />AI powers intelligent office experiences</h2>
<p>As many employees return to the office for at least a few days a week, traditional office setups are proving ill-equipped to support modern hybrid work. The role of the office has evolved from a mandatory place to work to a destination where employees engage in collaboration, ideation, training, and community building. However, with the rise of hybrid work, not everyone will be in the office at the same time, and only <strong><a href="https://www.webex.com/gp/hybrid-work-research-global-2024.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="">42% of employees</a></strong> believe their office is prepared to support hybrid work.</p>
<p>To create an immersive experience that makes everyone feel like an equal participant, workspaces need collaboration devices equipped with AI-driven audio and video intelligence. Cisco devices, with NVIDIA technology built in, are providing cutting-edge collaboration experiences, effectively bridging the gap between in-office teams and remote colleagues.</p>
<p>AI-powered collaboration devices have proven instrumental in boosting meeting effectiveness:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>81% reported significantly more effective meetings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>80% cited increased productivity, presentation quality, and collaboration abilities.&nbsp;</li>
<li>71% of remote workers felt a greater sense of inclusion during hybrid meetings.&nbsp;</li>
<li>86% experienced a significant reduction in fatigue and enhanced focus during meetings involving remote, in-room, or on-the-go participants.</li>
</ul>
<p>Niklas Mortensen, Managing Direct at Designit, sees the effect of AI-powered devices firsthand: “Collaboration across studios has become much more of a thing. It was not that we didn’t do it before, but now, borders don’t really matter anymore, because we can all collaborate and work remotely, and clients also see this.”</p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.webex.ai/ai-assistant-for-suite-devices-cx.html?tab=tab-devices" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><strong>audio and video intelligence</strong></a> built into each device, Cisco devices can help transform the workplace experience by bringing AI-powered capabilities to every workspace.<br /><br /></p>

<title>11 valuable contact center metrics to track in 2025</title>
<link>https://blog.webex.com/customer-experience/eleven-valuable-contact-center-metrics-to-track/</link>
<guid>https://blog.webex.com/customer-experience/eleven-valuable-contact-center-metrics-to-track/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Standard contact center metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) help businesses track and measure the success of their customer experience—particularly as it relates to their call or contact centers.</p>
<p>But which KPIs are the most valuable and relevant to your contact center operation? Which can help boost agent productivity and bottom-line performance? And, most importantly, how do you improve them?</p>
<p>As we prepare to enter 2025, it&#8217;s crucial to ensure that our contact center is equipped to meet the evolving needs of our customers. By understanding and optimizing key metrics, we can position ourselves for success in delivering exceptional customer experiences.</p>
<p>This guide will explore 11 metrics to track and why they’re essential. Plus, we’ll share best practices for measuring, acting on, and enhancing your most critical KPIs.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What’s the difference between call center and contact center metrics?</h2>
<p>Before jumping into it, let’s make an important distinction:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Call centers</strong> are communication hubs that focus specifically on telephony. As such, most of the KPIs they track involve total calls, average call length, and other phone-based metrics.</li>
<li><strong>Contact centers</strong> are larger, more comprehensive, and increasingly <a href="https://blog.webex.com/customer-experience/delivering-on-the-customer-experience-imperative/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=""><strong>omnichannel</strong></a>. In addition to telephony, they handle channels like social media, email, SMS, live chat, and more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite their differences, the KPIs generally overlap. Most standard call center metrics are not only applicable but also beneficial to contact center operations. And, since <a href="https://www.businessleader.co.uk/research-phone-calls-preferred-customer-service/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=""><strong>61% of people</strong></a> still prefer phone calls for customer service, they can’t be overlooked.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">11 essential call center metrics and KPIs</h2>
<p>You can break most metrics down into three categories:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Customer experience (CX):</strong> CX KPIs help you measure customer interaction quality, which can impact how consumers feel about your brand—and in turn, customer loyalty. Low scores reflect poor satisfaction, whereas high scores represent happy, satisfied customers.</li>
<li><strong>Agent performance:</strong> This type of contact center KPI measures <a href="https://www.webex.com/products/workforce-optimization.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=""><strong>agent productivity</strong></a> and how well they’re handling each customer interaction. Why? Because agent performance directly impacts CX. These analytics, in turn, support quality assurance.</li>
<li><strong>Operational performance:</strong> Contact center performance metrics track the overall success of your operation within a given period. Improving performance metrics may reduce costs, increase profits, and enable you to deliver a better customer experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>For each of these buckets, there are numerous KPIs you might track. Let’s narrow down your choices and explore 11 of the most valuable:</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Call arrival rate</h3>
<p>Call arrival rate refers to the total number of calls, or call volume, your contact center receives in a certain period. For example, a call center manager might measure call volume per minute, hour, day, week, or month, depending on their specific needs.<br /><br />Analyzing call arrival patterns helps you anticipate peak periods of activity and adjust staffing levels accordingly. This makes it easier to maintain service level agreements and meet performance targets—plus, you can optimize workloads, avoid overwhelming employees, and reduce agent turnover.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Blocked call percentage</h3>
<p>When agents are busy and unavailable to take an incoming call, customers are typically met with a busy tone. This counts as a blocked call because a customer couldn’t get through immediately. A high percentage of blocked calls may indicate a staffing or other organizational problem.</p>
<p>Even worse, it’s a frustrating customer experience. Consumers want fast, if not immediate, responses from brands. Speed positively impacts customer loyalty: According to Forrester, people are <a href="https://www.forrester.com/blogs/whats-the-roi-of-cx-transformation/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=""><strong>twice as likely</strong></a> to stick with companies that solve their problems quickly.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Average call abandonment rate</h3>
<p>Your abandonment rate measures how many customers hang up before contacting a contact center agent. An abandoned call can happen for many reasons, which makes this tricky to analyze—but it’s essential nonetheless.</p>
<p>A rising abandonment rate signals dissatisfaction, which may be due to a high inbound call volume and too few agents around to answer. Tracking this metric over time will help identify potential causes and quantify the impact of any changes.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. First response time (FRT)</h3>
<p>FRT measures how long it takes before a customer is connected to an available agent. A slow average response time could indicate that there are too many cases for agents to handle, that agents aren’t acting quickly enough, or your technology capabilities are lacking.</p>
<p>Of course, a good FRT depends on the channel. According to CX Today, the <a href="https://www.cxtoday.com/contact-centre/what-is-first-response-time-and-how-can-i-measure-it/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=""><strong>industry standard</strong></a> for telephony is that 80% of calls are answered in 20 seconds or less.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">5. First contact resolution (FCR)</h3>
<p>First contact resolution measures the percentage of customer inquiries or issues resolved on the first attempt without the need for follow-up interactions. A high FCR indicates efficient problem-solving and customer satisfaction, whereas low scores suggest the opposite.</p>
<p>If you’re dealing with poor FCR, your agents may lack the resources to handle inquiries effectively. For instance, a lack of contextual understanding or customer data could make addressing problems at first contact challenging.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">6. Average handling time (AHT)</h3>
<p>As the name suggests, average handling time tracks the average time it takes agents to complete the customer interaction. It measures the entire duration of the engagement, including any after-call work agents must do to wrap up the case. Notably, there are other KPIs that can contribute to AHT, such as average call length or average hold time.</p>
<p>That said, high AHT doesn’t necessarily mean there’s a problem. The trick is reconciling speed and efficiency with excellent customer service. Employees who exceed handle time benchmarks may not be addressing customer needs as well as others who spend more time on the case.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">7. Customer satisfaction (CSAT)</h3>
<p>The customer satisfaction score, or CSAT, is a must-have contact center metric. CSAT scores measure customer satisfaction based on post-call surveys and feedback, usually on a scale-based system. For example, you can frame questions like this:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>On a scale of 1-10, how happy are you with your experience?</li>
<li>How would you rate your satisfaction with the interaction? (Unsatisfied, somewhat satisfied, very satisfied).</li>
</ul>
<p>Measuring CSAT scores can help managers with quality assurance by quantifying agent performance. However, qualitative responses are also valuable, as they give context to numerical data.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">8. Net promoter score (NPS)</h3>
<p>Net promoter score measures long-term customer loyalty. Like CSAT, it’s calculated through surveys, which you can send immediately after an interaction or some time afterward.</p>
<p>Most NPS surveys ask how likely the recipient is to recommend the company to others, rating their answer 1-10. This allows you to divide respondents into three groups:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Promoters (score 9-10)</strong> are highly loyal customers who will likely recommend your company.</li>
<li><strong>Passives (score 7-8)</strong> are satisfied but unenthusiastic about your brand.</li>
<li><strong>Detractors</strong> <strong>(score 0-6)</strong> are unhappy with their experience and may discourage others from engaging with your business.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">9. Customer effort score (CES)</h3>
<p>Customer effort score measures how difficult it is for consumers to fulfill their needs when they contact your company. Generally speaking, CES helps you understand whether customers must jump through hoops to get what they want and resolve their issues.</p>
<p>Notably, customer effort score is related to loyalty. According to Gartner, <strong><a href="https://emt.gartnerweb.com/ngw/globalassets/en/sales-service/documents/trends/customer-value-advantage-ebook.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="">only 37% of consumers</a></strong> remain loyal to a brand after a “high effort resolution.” On the other hand, 61% stay loyal if the experience is quick and easy.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">10. Service level rate</h3>
<p>Contact centers typically have service level agreements (SLA), which are standards used to uphold expectations and keep customers happy. For instance, on average, you might aim to answer emails within four hours or less or that all answered calls are resolved within 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Service level rates are a good way to track operational efficiency over time. They also help you identify patterns or areas of improvement.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">11. Agent turnover</h3>
<p>Turnover rates measure the percentage of employees leaving your company in a specific period, normally a year. The agent turnover rate is notoriously high for contact centers—<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4008034-1&amp;h=2636326688&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fecommons.cornell.edu%2Fserver%2Fapi%2Fcore%2Fbitstreams%2Fe4ae98ca-9034-4f68-8be9-86885905f403%2Fcontent&amp;a=study" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=""><strong>twice that</strong></a> of other industries. There are many reasons someone might leave your company, but burnout is responsible for at least 50% of cases, costing organizations millions of dollars each year.</p>
<p>Tracking turnover is vital, not just for business performance but for employee well-being. A high churn rate could suggest agents are overwhelmed, possibly by call volume or other factors. It may even indicate operational or procedural issues that require fixing.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to enhance metrics for a better contact center operation</h2>
<p></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-423043" src="https://webexblogstg.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/enhance-metrics-for-a-better-contact-center.jpg" /></figure>
<p></p>
<p>Once you know what to measure, how do you boost your numbers? Here are some best practices for giving your contact center a lift:</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Optimize call-handling processes</h3>
<p>A great way to significantly drive improvements is by focusing on your call-handling strategies. Some measures you can take include:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Streamline call routing and escalation processes to minimize hold times and ensure calls are directed to the most appropriate agent or department. Skills-based routing, for instance, can automatically distribute cases to employees based on their proficiencies, ensuring inquiries are handled effectively.</li>
<li>Implement scripting and call flow guidelines to standardize interactions and ensure consistency in service quality.</li>
<li>Encourage active listening and empathy among agents to build rapport with customers and enhance their overall experience.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Enhance contact center technology</h3>
<p>Advanced platforms can provide a full suite of solutions tailored to call center operations and the customer experience. For example, Webex Contact Center allows you to:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Leverage voice- and text-based virtual agents, automatic call distribution (ACD) systems, and more. These tools not only provide self-service options for customers to find answers independently but they also free human agents of mundane tasks.</li>
<li>Use analytics tools to track and analyze metrics in real time, all from one convenient source of truth. Comprehensive dashboards make it easy to identify trends and make data-driven decisions.</li>
<li>Harness <a href="https://www.webex.com/products/contact-center-AI.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=""><strong>artificial intelligence</strong></a> (AI) to empower agents with full contextual knowledge, past customer histories, suggested responses, and more. These capabilities reduce burnout while also maximizing agent productivity and improving customer satisfaction.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Gather and act on customer feedback</h3>
<p>What better way to collect insights than your customers themselves? Webex Contact Center, you can:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Implement post-call surveys or feedback mechanisms to feed data into your analytics dashboard automatically.</li>
<li>Analyze customer feedback to identify recurring issues or areas for improvement and take proactive steps to address them, such as by coaching agents.</li>
<li>Drive continuous improvement initiatives and prioritize those that will impact customer satisfaction most.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Give call center agents the tools they need to succeed</h3>
<p>Measuring performance is easy with a comprehensive platform that automatically collects and analyzes data. With Webex Contact Center, you not only gain a fully featured suite of AI-powered capabilities but also the means to activate insights at scale. Generate reports, pinpoint patterns, and identify achievements—all from one pane of glass.</p>

This expansion supports our enterprise customers and partners in the UK by providing improved service reliability, enhanced compliance, and solutions for evolving regulatory requirements post-Brexit.</p>
<p>Our new Webex Calling data center is located in Manchester and complements our existing data center in London. Both UK data centers support multi-tenant and <a href="https://help.webex.com/en-us/article/dk3o5r/Introduction-to-Dedicated-Instance" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="">Dedicated Instance</a> deployment models for Webex Calling. The addition of Cisco’s second UK data center for Webex Calling ensures that both active and redundant calling media and signaling data remains within the UK region.</p>

<p>Our second UK data center will benefit Webex Calling customers in commercial and enterprise markets, as well as regulated industries such as finance and government, that require calling (media and signaling) data to reside in the UK.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Customer expectations and the way customers engage with businesses have forever changed. The new reality is that customers expect to interact with businesses via any digital channel, not just over the phone. And if they do pick up the phone to talk to your customer service team, they also expect you to know who they are and what they need from your company.</p>
<p>The most memorable customer experiences are created when agents have historical context about the customer, are armed with the right resources to serve them, and are given intuitive collaboration tools to get help from other teams to quickly solve for their customer’s needs. This means that customer service is no longer an afterthought but has become the front door, and customer service agents are now the face of the company to provide memorable first impressions. In fact, providing exceptional customer experience is now every employee’s responsibility, not just limited to a specific department.</p>
<p></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Many business functions benefit from process optimization—and your contact center is no exception. Streamlining contact center workflows means less stress on your agents, faster resolutions for your customers, and more money in your pocket.</p>
<p>Here, we’re talking all about contact center optimization including how to augment your processes, which KPIs to track, and more.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why you should optimize your contact center</h2>
<p>Efficient contact center operations are not just advantageous, but instead necessary for sustained business. With disjointed processes and inefficient workflows, your contact center cannot run at an optimal pace and function as it should.</p>
<p>When things start to slow down as a result of disorganization, you risk:</p>
<ol>
</ol>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What’s standing in the way of contact center optimization?</h2>
<p></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-423043" src="https://webexblogstg.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/way-contact-center-optimization.jpg" /></figure>
<p></p>
<p>Businesses face a handful of hurdles between where they currently are and a fully optimized contact center operation—some of them are real, others are perceived. Effective optimization involves identifying the following challenges with clarity, addressing them systematically, and implementing targeted solutions to overcome these obstacles and drive continual improvement.</p>
<p><strong>Legacy systems and infrastructure:</strong> Outdated technology infrastructure notoriously limits the ability of contact centers to adopt new tools that can improve their customer service processes. Legacy systems often lack compatibility with modern software solutions, such as cloud-based services and artificial intelligence (AI)-driven omnichannel communication platforms. This incompatibility can result in expensive and disruptive overhauls, acting as a significant optimization barrier.</p>
<p><strong>Budget constraints:</strong> Both the software and hardware associated with contact center optimization—such as advanced VoIP phones, high-performance servers, and CRM systems, among other assets—often require significant investment. Fortunately, there are cost-effective, yet highly efficient contact center solutions available that allow organizations to optimally function and scale. To those ends, <strong><a href="https://www.webex.com/us/en/products/customer-experience/contact-center.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="">Webex Contact Center</a></strong> provides agents with AI-driven insights and tools—integrating seamlessly with existing systems to offer flexible, scalable solutions that accommodate various budgetary constraints.</p>
<p><strong>Data silos and integration challenges:</strong> The use of multiple platforms leads to scattered data, complicating efforts to create a unified view of customer interactions, agent responsiveness, and other key metrics. This fragmentation obstructs efficient service delivery as agents cannot access complete customer histories or insights from other communication channels, leading to service gaps.</p>
<p><strong>High contact center agent turnover:</strong> With <strong><a href="https://ecommons.cornell.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/e4ae98ca-9034-4f68-8be9-86885905f403/content" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="">44% of agents</a> </strong>actively seeking new work, contact centers face continual disruptions to service continuity and quality. Constant agent training and hiring drain resources and focus from strategic initiatives—degrading the quality of customer service as new agents take time to reach the proficiency of their predecessors.</p>
<p><strong>Resistance to change:</strong> While <strong><a href="https://www.pritchettnet.com/how-much-resistance-to-change-is-normal-0#:~:text=Another%2050%20percent%20of%20the,30%20percent%20are%20the%20resisters." rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="">half of employees</a></strong> are neutral to change, approximately 30% are reluctant. That leaves just 20% who are open to new processes that can improve operations. Hence why strategic change management is so important. Rather than abruptly imposing new systems and practices, successful change management involves engaging with and educating employees on the benefits of new technologies and processes, thereby fostering receptiveness.</p>
<p>To address these challenges, businesses need to use a solution that’s easily adaptable, compatible, and conducive with operational needs. <strong><a href="https://www.webex.com/us/en/products/customer-experience/contact-center.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="">Webex Contact Center</a></strong> is just that: a comprehensive and adaptable platform that seamlessly integrates with both new and existing systems. This compatibility eases the transition for businesses moving from legacy systems to advanced, AI-driven solutions. By providing agents with AI-driven tools and valuable insights within a cost-effective framework, Webex Contact Center enables organizations to overcome budget constraints, data silos, high agent turnover, and resistance to change, thereby facilitating optimal contact center performance.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to optimize your contact center</h2>
<p></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-423043" src="https://webexblogstg.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/optimize-your-contact-center.jpg" /></figure>
<p></p>
<p>Optimizing a contact center involves a strategic approach to managing resources, integrating technology, monitoring performance, continuously training staff, refining processes, and supporting multiple communication channels.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Resource management</h3>
<p>Effective resource management is anchored in predictive analytics and real-time responsiveness. By leveraging historical data, contact center managers can predict peak periods and adjust staffing levels accordingly. Predictive analytics tools analyze past trends, considering variables such as time of day, seasonal demand, and marketing campaigns. This data informs a dynamic contact center scheduling system that aligns agent shifts with anticipated call volumes, ensuring optimal staffing without underutilization or overload.</p>
<p>Moreover, real-time monitoring tools enable immediate adjustments to staffing when unexpected deviations from predictions occur, thus maintaining service levels without incurring unnecessary labor costs.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Technology integration</h3>
<p>A unified agent desktop that integrates CRM, ACD, IVR, and outbound communication tools into one interface reduces the time agents spend navigating systems, thereby decreasing Average Handle Time (AHT) and improving the customer experience. Additionally, advanced IVR systems can be used not only for routing but also for resolving standard inquiries without agent intervention, effectively decreasing call volumes.</p>
<p>Today, integration extends to include AI. Generative AI-fueled chatbots are increasingly handling initial customer interactions, gathering necessary information, and solving routine problems. These AI-fueled chatbots can process natural language, understand customer intent, and provide accurate responses based on the data accessed from integrated systems. Their advanced capabilities have led to <strong><a href="https://masterofcode.com/blog/chatbot-statistics" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="">more than seven out of ten</a></strong> customers (74%) saying that they prefer to speak to AI for simple queries, rather than human agents.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Performance monitoring and analysis</h3>
<p>Optimizing your contact center means adopting a data-driven approach. To help measure the effectiveness of your contact center, you can track the following key performance indicators (KPIs).</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Average handle time (AHT): </strong>Average Handle Time refers to the average duration agents take to handle a customer interaction from start to finish. This includes talk time, hold time, and the time spent on related tasks after the customer interaction ends (after-call work).<br /><br />AHT is calculated using the formula:<br /><br /><em>AHT = Total talk time + total hold time + total after-call work time ÷ total number of calls handled</em><br /><br />AHT is typically measured using telephony and customer support software that automatically logs these times for each agent interaction.<br /><br /></li>
<li><strong>First-call resolution rate</strong>: First-call resolution rate measures the percentage of customer issues or inquiries resolved during the first interaction, without the need for any follow-up. FCR can be tracked through CRM systems where agents mark whether an issue was resolved in the first interaction, and this can be corroborated with follow-up data.<br /><br />FCR is calculated by dividing the number of calls resolved on the first contact by the total number of calls, then multiplying by 100 to express it as a percentage.<br /><br /><em>FCR = ( total number of calls ÷ number of first contact resolutions ​) x 100%</em><br /><br /></li>
<li><strong>Response time</strong>: Response time is the average time it takes for a customer to receive a response from an agent upon initiating contact, whether through a call, chat, email, or any other support channel.<br />For calls, it is the time from when a call is received to when an agent answers it. For digital customer inquiries like emails or chat messages, it is the time from the customer’s message to an agent’s first reply.<br /><br /></li>
<li><strong>Customer satisfaction scores (CSAT):</strong> Customer satisfaction scores measure how satisfied customers are with their interaction with the contact center.<br /><br />CSAT is typically calculated by asking customers to rate their satisfaction on a scale—i.e., 1 to 5, or 1 to 10. The scores from these ratings are then averaged to provide a composite score. Often, only top box responses—i.e., ratings of 5 on a 5-point scale—are considered in calculating a percentage of satisfied customers.<br /><br /></li>
<li><strong>Agent productivity: </strong>Agent productivity measures the agents’ efficiency in handling customer interactions and is often assessed by the volume of interactions they manage within a given period.<br /><br />This can be measured in terms of the number of calls handled, emails responded to, or chat sessions managed per hour or per shift. Productivity metrics are recorded and analyzed through the same CRM or customer interaction management software that tracks other KPIs, providing a dashboard view of individual and team performance.<br /></li>
</ul>
<p>By systematically measuring these KPIs, contact centers can identify performance bottlenecks, training needs, and opportunities for process improvement—all aimed at enhancing the overall customer experience and operational efficiency.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Training and development</h3>
<p>Effective training ultimately yields a better employee experience. Training and development in a contact center must be an ongoing effort that adapts to emerging needs and technologies. This requires a structured training program that includes initial intensive training sessions for new hires and continuous learning opportunities for existing staff.</p>
<p>Utilizing a blend of e-learning, instructor-led training, and peer mentoring can accommodate different learning styles and ensure comprehensive knowledge transfer. Moreover, simulation-based training and real-time coaching using analytics from live calls can further enhance training effectiveness, helping agents improve their skills in handling complex scenarios.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Process optimization</h3>
<p>Continuous process optimization requires you to regularly review existing workflows, identify bottlenecks, and implement improvements. This may involve automating data entry tasks, streamlining information retrieval processes, or redesigning the escalation path for complex issues. Each process change should aim to reduce effort and time from the customer’s and agent’s perspective, measured by reduced interaction times and improved satisfaction scores.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Multichannel support</h3>
<p>Ensuring effective multichannel support involves integrating various communication platforms while maintaining consistency in service quality across all channels. This requires a unified agent interface that provides comprehensive customer context irrespective of the communication channel.</p>
<p>Specifically, the unified interface should allow agents to seamlessly access customer information, interaction history, and any previous concerns raised across channels such as phone, email, chat, and social media. This integration helps prevent redundancy and ensures that customers do not have to repeat information, enhancing the customer experience. Additionally, the system should be equipped with functionality to switch between channels effectively, allowing agents to continue conversations on different platforms without loss of context or service quality.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In today&#8217;s dynamic business landscape, it&#8217;s essential to provide exceptional customer experiences (CX) efficiently while alleviating the burden on agents. This requires the use of automation and related technologies to expedite and manage manual processes, ensuring they keep up with fast-changing customer expectations.</p>
<p>Fortunately, business process automation offers a solution, particularly tools such as artificial intelligence (AI). These innovative tools enable companies to streamline contact center operations, making tasks more manageable and, at the same time:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Uplift the employee experience</li>
<li>Improve customer satisfaction</li>
<li>Increase operational efficiency</li>
<li>Maximize the return on investment (ROI)</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#8217;s crucial to strategically implement automation in business processes. To begin, we&#8217;ll discuss emerging contact center trends that are shaping the future of automation and offer insights on how your business can make the most of these developments.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">10 trends shaping contact center automation</h2>
<p>Staying updated on automation can help keep your business on the cutting edge. Let’s review the 10 most powerful contact center automation trends:</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1: Conversational AI for self-service</h3>
<p>According to Deloitte’s <a href="https://www.deloittedigital.com/us/en/insights/research/contact-center-survey.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=""><strong>2023 survey</strong></a>, contact centers rank new self-service capabilities as their top investment priority. In fact, 90% of leaders will invest in such solutions over the next two years, citing a desire to increase virtual agent interactions.</p>
<p>In short, a virtual agent is an example of robotic process automation. It uses conversational AI and natural language processing to handle routine tasks and customer issues without human agent intervention. This can streamline first-contact resolution and improve customer satisfaction, providing fast and easy support.</p>
<p>Generally, these self-service tools come in two varieties:</p>
<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Chatbots:</strong> Organizations can embed live chat features on websites where consumers ask the virtual agent questions. It can direct the user to relevant resources and departments, routing them based on a company and customer data knowledge base.</li>
<li><strong>Interactive voice response (IVR):</strong> Voice-based virtual agents can augment IVR systems with intelligent automation. Much like a chatbot, conversational IVRs process information in real time, allowing them to respond with relevant answers.</li>
</ol>
<p>These systems provide a tangible boost to operational efficiency. <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/operations/our-insights/operations-blog/why-ivr-still-matters-in-an-ai-world" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=""><strong>McKinsey estimates</strong></a> that IVR systems can improve customer satisfaction (CSAT) scores by five times and reduce the number of live-agent calls by over 10%.</p>
<p>By streamlining routine tasks, automation technology empowers contact center agents to focus on other responsibilities, knowing that the system can automatically elevate the user to a human agent for more complex inquiries while retaining a complete history of the previous interaction.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Sentiment analysis and speech analytics</h3>
<p>The rapid growth of speech analytics is another automation trend leaning heavily on artificial intelligence. Combined with sentiment analysis, this emerging technology is helping contact center agents gain insight into consumer sentiment.</p>
<p>How does it work? Machine learning algorithms use natural language understanding (NLU) to process phonetic signals. In other words, it analyzes the customer’s speech pattern and tone during the interaction. Then, it classifies the call as positive, neutral, or negative.</p>
<p>This solution provides valuable insight into the customer experience. For instance, supervisors can compare scores against automated transcripts to understand why the call was positive or negative. This can help improve agent training and script compliance, not to mention quality assurance.</p>
<p>Plus, there’s a real business impact. According to McKinsey, speech analytics can drive cost savings of up to 30% and improve CSAT scores by 10%.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Customer-centricity</h3>
<p>The third trend shaping contact center automation is the continued rise of customer-centricity. The idea is simple: Putting customer needs first won’t only improve your brand image, but it can also lead to several <strong><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2023/10/18/benefits-and-pitfalls-of-the-customer-first-business-approach/?sh=62e53e464437" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="">competitive advantages</a>.</strong> For example, customer-centric organizations can expect:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Stronger retention</strong>: A positive customer experience may lead to more frequent purchases, maximizing lifetime value.</li>
<li><strong>Reduced churn:</strong> Meeting customer expectations will delight consumers, giving them fewer reasons to abandon their brands for a competitor.</li>
<li><strong>Better decision-making:</strong> Focusing on CX allows you to analyze customer behavior. These findings, in turn, provide valuable insight into preferences, trends, and motivations.</li>
</ul>
<p>As this new service model grows popular, organizations can leverage automation technology to make it more targeted and effective. After all, no two consumers are the same—and that’s why customer interaction analytics are so important.</p>
<p>AI-powered contact center solutions can automatically capture, transcribe, and analyze interactions. This makes it easier to understand the nuance behind granular customer needs and whether agents are meeting them effectively. Topic analysis, for example, provides insight into why consumers are reaching out. Moreover, it allows you to view trending topics and identify areas of interest or potential friction.</p>
<p>By mining interaction data, automation technology makes driving continuous improvement easier. This means you can pinpoint patterns in associate activity and customer feedback—and, in turn, develop ways to improve agent productivity, customer satisfaction, and operational efficiency, paving the way for a brighter future.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Generative AI for agent assistance</h3>
<p>Perhaps the most impactful automation trend is that of generative AI. Powered by large language models (LLMs), this type of artificial intelligence is uniquely adept at producing various forms of content, including original text, audio, and imagery.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2023-08-30-gartner-reveals-three-technologies-that-will-transform-customer-service-and-support-by-2028" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=""><strong>Gartner predicts</strong></a> that by 2025, 80% of customer service and customer support organizations will use it to improve agent productivity and CX. Why? Because the use cases are practically endless, and the technology is readily available.</p>
<p>Webex Contact Center, for instance, offers a suite of <a href="https://www.webex.ai/ai-assistant-for-suite-devices-cx.html?tab=tab-cx" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=""><strong>generative capabilities</strong></a>:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Chat summarization:</strong> People hate repeating themselves, which often happens when chatbots escalate customer issues to a human agent. Generative AI can eliminate this pain point by automatically creating a recap of every chat, call, and conversation—even ones that drop. This ensures full contextual awareness and seamless transition between channels.</li>
<li><strong>Suggested responses:</strong> As a virtual assistant, AI tools can automatically recommend replies based on customer data, such as their previous interactions and behaviors. This speeds up the response process, supporting operational efficiency while giving customers the answers they need faster than ever.</li>
<li><strong>Automated agent answers:</strong> Generative AI can expedite the interaction by tapping into the company’s knowledge base for quick, accurate answers. For example, it can make suggestions for articles that address customer inquiries, highlighting the most relevant part of the content for easy reference.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">5. AI-powered burnout detection</h3>
<p></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-423043" src="https://webexblogstg.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/ai-powered-burnout-detection.jpg" /></figure>
<p></p>
<p>Contact center agents work hard to deliver a positive customer experience. Going above and beyond can have negative impacts on the workforce. In fact, according to a <a href="https://ecommons.cornell.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/e4ae98ca-9034-4f68-8be9-86885905f403/content" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=""><strong>2020 study</strong></a>, agent turnover is double that of any other industry. Burnout causes 50% of the churn, which costs businesses nearly $5 million annually on average.</p>
<p>That’s a big problem, but fortunately, <a href="https://www.webex.com/products/workforce-optimization.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=""><strong>technology provides several solutions</strong></a>. For instance, Webex Contact Center offers AI-powered agent burnout detection. It’s an automation tool that uses AI to identify agents at risk of burning out, allowing supervisors to step in and lend a hand.</p>
<p>In addition to wellness, Webex can help managers coach agents to success, such as after a difficult call or part of the regular training process. AI-driven coaching highlights generate a centralized dashboard where you can quickly view the highest- and lowest-rated interactions.</p>
<p>This tool summarizes the conversation and recommends ways to coach employees based on its findings. This way, whether identifying best practices or inefficiencies, you can always drive continuous improvement.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">6. The proliferation of omnichannel customer support</h3>
<p>Today’s businesses are committed to meeting customer needs, wherever they may be. The only problem? Consumers are using more channels than ever before, especially when it comes to brand engagement. This has given rise to omnichannel contact center solutions, which use technology to manage all communication channels under one comprehensive roof.</p>
<p>Unified CX platforms provide agents with a single interface to access voice, SMS, live chat, email, and social media. This means employees can jump between tasks without skipping a beat. Moreover, thanks to their open architecture, organizations can remove the barriers between disparate platforms, enabling cross-channel data collection.</p>
<p>Why does this matter? It allows you to build more accurate profiles based on the latest customer data. This information drives personalization, which makes for more effective customer journey orchestration.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">7. Predictive analytics</h3>
<p>The contact center analytics market will reach <a href="https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/contact-center-analytics-market-A16642" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=""><strong>$8.1 billion</strong></a> by 2031. At that point, many organizations will leverage predictive analytics to their advantage. How? Here are some of the most notable use cases:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Workforce management:</strong> Predictive analytics use historical data to forecast call volumes, allowing you to optimize staffing decisions. They also factor historical trends and employee availability into the equation, ensuring you’re never under or over-staffed relative to customer demand. This can help reduce administrative effort while improving the employee experience.</li>
<li><strong>Customer behavior:</strong> Imagine knowing whether a specific customer is likely to churn. That type of knowledge would allow you to make informed decisions on retaining them, such as by sending them a personalized offer. Likewise, you can leverage AI’s predictive capabilities to estimate their Net Promote Score following an interaction.</li>
<li><strong>Auto dialing:</strong> Predictive dialers are a form of workflow automation that can help outbound contact centers improve their outreach. They place calls even before agents become available, thereby engaging as many leads as possible. In the case of an unanswered call, they move on to the next lead. But, if someone picks up, they route them to the next available agent. This enhances customer engagement while maximizing agent productivity.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">8. Advanced digital security</h3>
<p>Of course, of all contact center automation trends, none are quite as important as the need for advanced security. Cybercriminals and bad actors are targeting organizations at an accelerated rate, eager to exploit customer data. With their methods getting smarter and more sophisticated, introducing automated protection has never been so important.</p>
<p>When it comes to financial services, such as banking or credit unions, it&#8217;s crucial for the customer support team to verify the caller&#8217;s identity before sharing any personal or financial information. The conventional method involves asking the customer a series of questions to confirm their identity. However, this approach has two main drawbacks:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>It’s ineffective if a bad actor can access the customer’s personal information and easily bypass the authentication questions.</li>
<li>It can be a tedious and burdensome process for legitimate users who want quick access to customer support.</li>
</ul>
<p>Modern contact center solutions offer alternative ways to verify identity without compromising security or the customer experience. With an open architecture platform, organizations can integrate AI-powered biometric authentication tools.</p>
<p>Rather than questioning the customer, they use vocal analytics and/or facial recognition to verify they are who they claim to be. This process is much faster but also more adept at identifying potential fraud.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">9. Intelligent routing and call queuing</h3>
<p>Routing is one of the most basic contact center functions but also one of the most essential. Manually deciding how to route inbound cases can be slow, error-prone, and inefficient. That’s why modern contact center platforms use workflow automation to streamline and simplify the process.</p>
<p>Predictive routing strategies allocate cases to the most appropriate agent based on predefined criteria. In the case of skills-based routing, you can grade agents according to their talents and/or areas of expertise. IVR systems will automatically route inbound customers to the employee who’s best equipped to handle their type of inquiry.</p>
<p>Similarly, AI-powered tools can also simplify call queue management. Using predictive analytics, they can estimate wait times for customers in the queue. They also announce the caller’s place in line, letting them know they’re steadily advancing to the front. Plus, customers can schedule a callback if they don’t want to wait, which the IVR can place automatically.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">10. Continued rise of cloud infrastructure</h3>
<p>It’s no secret that cloud-based solutions are becoming more popular. Not only are they inherently more scalable than traditional systems, but they easily integrate with other services. This enables more advanced automation technology, which, of course, enhances operational efficiency.</p>
<p>Better yet, cloud platforms don’t require an enormous upfront investment. Delivered as a service, they help you transform your customer support team into a strategic asset—not a cost center. In fact, according to <a href="https://www.webex.com/gp/forrester-tei-contact-center.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=""><strong>Forrester Consulting</strong></a>, Cisco’s cloud-based Webex Contact Center can generate an ROI of over 300%.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Find your ideal automation solution</h3>
<p>Intelligent automation is a smart move if customer experience is critical to your business. That’s why we’ve built Webex Contact Center with a suite of innovative, automated, and AI-powered solutions.</p>
<p>From generative AI for agent assistance to conversational AI for self-service, our cloud-based platform is fully stocked with all the tools you need to turn CX into a competitive advantage. With workforce optimization, intelligent routing, and omnichannel support, Webex Contact Center can take your operations to the next level.</p>

<title>Driving sustainable hybrid work with Cisco devices</title>

<guid>https://blog.webex.com/workspaces/driving-sustainable-hybrid-work-with-cisco-devices/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Sustainability and hybrid work goes <strong><a href="https://blogs.cisco.com/our-corporate-purpose/sustainability-101-how-hybrid-work-can-advance-sustainability-in-the-workforce" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">together</a></strong>. Equipping your offices with beautifully designed Cisco devices allows you to bridge the distance between teams, leverage powerful data and insights, and infuse your workspaces with intelligence. It can also help you get closer to your sustainability goals. From circular design to active usage and optimization, all the way down to end-of-life management. Because we don’t just care about our own net-zero journey. We care about yours, too.</p>
<div>

</div>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Circular design</h2>
<p>As a society, we are using more natural resources than our planet can regenerate. It’s our responsibility to move from a linear consumption-based model to a circular one that looks beyond the current take-make-waste model and takes better care of our limited natural resources.</p>
<p>Cisco has committed to having 100 percent of new products and packaging to incorporate <strong><a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/m/en_us/about/csr/esg-hub/environment/product-sustainability.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">circular design principles</a> </strong>by 2025.  These principles encompass material use, standardization and modularization, packaging and accessories, smart energy consumption, and disassembly, reuse and repair. But what goes on behind the scenes, and how are we delivering on this when designing devices? The Cisco Devices business unit recently hit a big milestone – shipping 52.6% total post-consumer recycled plastic (PCR) in Q3, Fiscal Year 2024.</p>
<p>To exemplify how we translate these circular design principles to tangible sustainability outcomes, let’s have a look at the new 9800 Desk Phone series, which we launched at Enterprise Connect this year.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-425166" height="600" src="https://webexblogstg.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Cisco-devices-circular-design.jpg" width="980" /></figure>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>More than 74% of the plastic in the product is PCR plastic.</li>
<li>100% recyclable packaging.</li>
<li>Less than 2% paint</li>
<li>Over 93% of the main mechanical parts by weight could be disassembled by a common hand tool for ease of recycling, including plastic, metal, rubber, etc.&nbsp;</li>
<li>EnergyStar certified</li>
<li>Low-power modes for energy efficiency</li>
</ul>
<p>Moving into the meeting room and comparing our Cisco Room Bar to its predecessor, the Room Kit Mini, we reduced the packaging volume by 17 liters, allowing for 18 more units to be stacked on a pallet, increasing shipping efficiencies. We have minimized the use of single-use plastic and foam and created a 100% recyclable packaging that is expected to eliminate up to 165,000 pounds of packaging material per year. In addition to all of this, the Cisco Room Bar has been designed to be easy to repair, refurbish and recycle, extending and optimizing its overall lifecycle – just like the rest of our devices.<br /></p>

<div class="bc-video-wrapper"> 
<div>


</div>
</div>
<p></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Active usage</h2>
<p>Cisco is working to reduce its Scope 3 emissions, and as a result, our customers’ emissions by engineering more energy-efficient products. However, simply making energy efficient products is not enough – we must create solutions that help optimize energy usage. Cue Office Hours – a feature within Control Hub that allows you to turn off always-on features such as digital signage and automatic wakeups for a set number of hours. The device then goes into standby mode, which both helps you to save energy and extend the lifetime of your screens. A lot of our devices can go into a “deep sleep” mode, called Networked Standby. For example, when the Cisco Board Pro goes into a networked standby mode, we reduce the energy consumption&nbsp;by between 85% and 89%, depending on the model. * This radically reduces your energy bills and your emissions. Want to dig deeper into the different devices&#8217; energy consumption in different states? Check out&nbsp;our Cisco devices&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/td/docs/telepresence/endpoint/technical-papers/cisco-collaboration-devices-power-consumption-management.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><strong>power consumption management paper.</strong></a> </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Optimization and reporting</h2>
<p>You cannot improve what you cannot measure. Leveraging the power of our platform, you can find an overview of your devices’ energy usage and associated carbon emissions in the sustainability tab in Control Hub. The carbon emission estimates from the devices’ usage are based on standardized formulas from agencies like the U.S Environmental Protection Agency, however admins can also input their own power-to-CO2 emission factors. Additionally, you can <strong><a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/td/docs/telepresence/endpoint/technical-papers/cisco-collaboration-devices-power-consumption-management.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">pull reports</a> </strong> on the devices’ power consumption in different modes and use that information to create custom calculations – making sustainability reporting that much easier.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">End-of-life management</h2>
<p>Cisco has committed to having 100% product returns. This is why we have The Cisco Takeback and Reuse Program. This program lets Cisco equipment owners return hardware that has reached end-of-use, at no cost. As always with Cisco, security is a top priority, so any returned equipment is stored in a secure location and data is cleared from returned hard drives to protect data security.</p>
<p>By investing in Cisco devices, you are not only investing in amazing hybrid employee experiences, but also in quality, longevity and sustainability. Learn more about our sustainability efforts <a href="https://www.cisco.com/site/us/en/about/purpose/environmental-sustainability/index.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><strong>here.</strong></a></p>

<title>Announcing the availability of industry-first Webex AI Codec, ...</title>
<link>https://blog.webex.com/collaboration/announcing-the-availability-of-industry-first-webex-ai-codec-transforming-your-audio-experiences/</link>
<guid>https://blog.webex.com/collaboration/announcing-the-availability-of-industry-first-webex-ai-codec-transforming-your-audio-experiences/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>We announced our <a href="https://webexblogstg.wpenginepowered.com/hybrid-work/next-level-audio-with-webex-ai-codec/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><strong>industry-first Webex AI Codec last year</strong></a> and I am very excited to share that it is now generally available (GA), in the Webex app, enabling you to intelligently transform your audio experiences during calls and meetings.</p>
<p>Here at <a href="https://www.webex.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><strong>Webex</strong></a>, we continue to focus on creating exceptional experiences between employees and customers. Today, AI plays an important role in the way we collaborate and interact with each other, and our pervasive AI across the Webex Platform works silently in the background to improve communications, productivity and remove barriers whether collaborating internally or externally.</p>
<p>Even though the AI conversation feels new, we have been implementing AI into the entire Webex portfolio for the last decade.&nbsp;Webex has been at the forefront with <strong> <a href="https://www.webex.ai/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">AI innovations</a></strong>  and is known for delivering industry-leading video and audio quality, starting with our <a href="https://youtu.be/yZbw188QcN8?si=NA0MFJxgeSS8bnTe" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><strong>award-winning background noise cancelation</strong></a> that enables you to work anywhere, without having to worry about crowded or loud environments. Since then, our commitment has continued to deliver other incredible innovations: Optimize for my Voice and for all Voices, enhancing the voice closest to the microphone, along with Audio Watermarking, <a href="https://www.webex.com/content/dam/www/us/en/documents/pdf/hd-voice-at-a-glance_CM-6232_v2.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><strong>HD Voice</strong></a>, and more.</p>
<p></p>
<div>

</div>
<p></p>
<p>As employees continue to embrace the hybrid workplace, often they work from mobile locations or on the go, which can result in poor audio quality, especially in challenging network conditions. When you’re on a call with someone, who is either driving or in an area with poor network conditions, we hear choppy audio and speech that is unintelligible. Current audio innovations and mitigation techniques, such as packet loss concealment, do not sufficiently address high packet loss scenarios.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Industry first Webex AI Codec: Experience next-level audio clarity</h2>
<p>Now, Webex AI Codec addresses these scenarios with a single, end-to-end solution for speech enhancement and highly resilient communications, ensuring crystal clear audio anywhere, on any device, under any conditions. Webex AI Codec intelligently adjusts the bitrates and redundancies, when encoding audio packets – becoming an industry first innovation and providing a real differentiating experience for our users.</p>
<p></p>
<div>

</div>
<p></p>
<p>When experiencing poor network quality with over 30% packet loss, whether collaborating using the Webex App on your desktop or mobile, Webex AI Codec will be triggered automatically, ensuring that that you can hear and be heard clearly.</p>
<p>Audio continues to be one of the most important aspects of collaboration and contributes significantly to providing the best experience for employees and customers. With Webex AI Codec, we can deliver remarkable audio quality, even with poor network conditions, while using a fraction of the bandwidth. If you are ready to supercharge your audio experience with AI-powered innovations such as Webex AI Codec and more, I encourage you to join our <strong><a href="https://cisco.webex.com/weblink/register/r5bd9e07b5dc1fa9d85569131307cd7e6" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">upcoming webinar</a></strong> to learn more or  <a href="https://use.webex.com/contact-sales?lang=en" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><strong>reach out to our Sales team</strong></a>  to discuss your specific needs.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In today’s fast paced digital environment, customer expectations are at an all-time high. Customers demand seamless and consistent journeys across all channels, advanced personalization, fast issue resolution, and humanlike support for self-service experiences. According to <a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/advisory-services/publications/consumer-intelligence-series/pwc-consumer-intelligence-series-customer-experience.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="">PwC study</a> (Experience is everything: Here’s how to get it right), one in three consumers say they will walk away from a brand they love after just one bad experience. This figure is even higher in Latin America. To respond to evolving customer needs, brands need to invest in the state-of-the-art customer experiences, making customer interactions seamless and helpful, while delivering consistent and contextual experiences across all channels.</p>
