<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>We are incredibly proud to announce that Gartner has recognized <strong>Cisco as a Leader in the 2024 Gartner Magic Quadrant for our Unified Communications as a Service (UCaaS) offerings</strong> for the <strong>6<sup>th</sup> consecutive year</strong>! We believe our positioning is a result of our unwavering vision and proven ability to execute. We are truly honored by this recognition.</p>
<p>At our core, Webex has always been about connecting people. As work has evolved, we’ve been ahead of the curve at investing in AI, tightly integrating collaboration hardware and software, and building a breadth of Unified Communications as a Service (UCaaS), Contact Center as a Service (CCaaS), and Communications Platform as a Service (CPaaS) capabilities. Our vision is to help even the world’s largest companies deliver a successful cloud transformation, and we are inspired by the possibilities ahead.</p>
<p>For us, this recognition is a testament to our team&#8217;s hard work, innovation, and commitment, and it signals the momentum we’ve built in reshaping the future of communications. We are one of the only two vendors recognized in three Magic Quadrant reports for CCaaS, CPaaS, and UCaaS.</p>
<p>Cisco was named <a href="https://cpaas.webex.com/blog/2024-gartner-magic-quadrant-for-cpaas" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="">a Visionary in the 2024 Gartner Magic Quadrant<img alt="™" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2122.png" style="height: 1em;" /> for Communications Platform as a Service (CPaaS),</a> and a Niche Player for <a href="https://blog.webex.com/customer-experience/gartner-contact-center-mq-2023/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="">Webex Contact Center in the 2023 Gartner Magic Quadrant<img alt="™" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2122.png" style="height: 1em;" /> for Contact Center as a Service (CCaaS<strong>)</strong>.</a></p>
<p><strong>We believe these three areas are core to our continued acknowledgement:</strong></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Our significant AI investments</strong> <strong>across the entire UCaaS portfolio</strong> are a testament to our commitment to innovation. These investments are not just about increasing employee productivity within Meetings, Messaging, Calling, Devices, and the Webex Suite, but also about delivering significant efficiency in Contact Center. They are a key factor in our continued success.</li>

<title>The cloud resurgence: How AI and Webex solutions are driving a ...</title>
<link>https://blog.webex.com/customer-experience/cloud-resurgence-how-ai-webex-solutions-driving-new-wave-deployments/</link>
<guid>https://blog.webex.com/customer-experience/cloud-resurgence-how-ai-webex-solutions-driving-new-wave-deployments/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>You&#8217;ve likely seen countless articles about moving contact centers to the cloud. And you might be wondering, &#8220;Will this one offer anything new?&#8221;</p>
<p>Stick around, and I&#8217;ll show you why it&#8217;s worth your time.</p>
<p>The cloud era is evolving with the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), which thrives on data and excels in cloud environments. AI is driving automation, helping businesses innovate and modernize their customer experience strategy.</p>
<p>If you manage a contact center, you understand the importance of balancing cost, efficiency, and customer satisfaction. AI makes this balance achievable.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why cloud is THE only way forward</h2>
<p>There’s more to investing in cloud and AI than meets the eye. First, if you’re running on legacy on-premises technology, you simply can’t innovate. You can try, but it will be painful, expensive, IT resource intensive, and slow &#8211; very slow.</p>
<p>When we think about innovation, AI is usually the first technology that comes to mind. But AI requires data and leveraging data becomes almost impossible with an on-premises system because it lacks the flexibility to integrate data from different sources. It’s unable to efficiently handle data aggregation, analysis, and prediction – all of which are crucial to a successful AI strategy.</p>
<p>On the other hand, AI is built into just about every piece of cloud software today, including CCaaS or contact center-as-a-service.</p>
<p>Secondly, you can’t digitize. Digital transformation isn’t just a buzzword – it’s a necessity in today’s world and another key reason why businesses are investing in the cloud. Consumers are tech-savvy, and they expect companies to take a digital-first approach to customer experience (CX). Research by <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Business%20Functions/Operations/Our%20Insights/The%20care%20of%20one%20Hyperpersonalization%20of%20customer%20care/The-care-of-one-Hyperpersonalization-of-customer-care.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">McKinsey &amp; Company </a>revealed that more than half of customers engage with three to five channels during each journey they take toward making a purchase or resolving a request. The challenge for contact centers lies in providing a set of seamlessly integrated digital channels that meet the needs of your most important revenue-generating, value-generating customer requests.</p>
<p>Which brings me to my third point. How do you know what your customers want, and which interactions are your most profitable ones? The answer is AI-driven data insights.</p>
<p>When combined with AI, data analytics provides a powerful tool to enhance how contact centers engage with their customers proactively and preemptively. AI can reveal insights hidden within your data, providing a deeper understanding of your customers and allowing you to optimize operations and resources for maximum efficiency.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">AI and cloud – a match made for innovation</h2>
<p>AI&#8217;s rapid development is deeply tied to the cloud, and Generative AI (GenAI) is further amplifying its relevance and importance. A cloud platform is truly optimal for providing the computing power, speed, scalability, and data storage necessary for advanced AI technologies to thrive. According to <a href="https://www.aberdeen.com/blog-posts/video-research-meets-reality-what-drives-cx-business-leaders-to-invest-in-ai-part-i/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Aberdeen Research</a>, 80% of companies are turning to AI to harness the potential of their existing data to drive enhanced customer experiences and impactful business outcomes.</p>
<p>AI enables businesses to engage with customers before they even reach out by predicting their needs and proactively delivering information, offering solutions, or helping resolve issues ahead of time.</p>
<p>Nowhere is customer data more accessible than in the contact center. AI and data are being used to create proactive communications outreach and hyper-personalized customer experiences that drive repeat business and increase brand loyalty. Let me give you a few examples.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Scenario 1: Unlock your edge with insights</h3>
<p>Ever wonder how to quickly discover what your customers are talking about when they engage with your call center? The solution is AI. By analyzing customer conversations, AI can identify recurring themes and provide your business with valuable insights that help improve customer experiences, enhance agent training, and uncover potential product or process issues. For example, if your contact center receives an unusually high volume of inquiries about a particular product, this trend alerts your teams that there might be market shifts or issues with your website or virtual agent.</p>
<p>Research by <a href="https://gitnux.org/business-automation-statistics/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Gitnux</a> indicates that 84% of executives report that AI will enable them to obtain or sustain a competitive advantage. Acting on these insights allows you to make targeted improvements that can not only reduce call volume, increase sales, and lower customer effort, but can also boost your competitive advantage.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Scenario 2: Laser-focused routing – every time</h3>
<p>When a customer or prospect is reaching your contact center, it’s crucial to get it right the first time. Meaning, you need to route them to the right resource that is most qualified to help them in the quickest, most efficient way. Based on what channel the customer is using, be it chat, email, or voice, and the reason for their query, AI can determine which inquiries can be handled by a virtual agent and which ones will be longer and more complex in nature and likely require assistance from a customer service agent.</p>
<p>AI can also analyze customer history, previous buying patterns, and behavior to predict future behaviors and their potential lifetime value. With this insight, AI can route your customers to specific teams or customer service agents with the right skills, delivering a “just in time” personalized experience and driving a more predictable, profitable business outcome.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Scenario 3: Increase customer satisfaction – before it’s too late</h3>
<p>When it comes to CSAT scores, we understand the importance of having insights into both your highest and lowest ratings to continuously improve and prevent customer churn. That’s why we’ve developed automatic customer satisfaction (CSAT) scores.</p>
<p>Leveraging our native AI capabilities, this feature predicts post-interaction CSAT scores, allowing contact centers to tap into data from every interaction instead of just the typical 3-10% response rate from post-interaction surveys.</p>
<p>This advanced capability within Webex Contact Center analyzes call recordings and other crucial interaction elements like sentiment, tone of voice, hold times, and transcripts – factors often overlooked by survey responses, and provides valuable information about how your customers feel about your brand. These insights empower your business to understand both what’s working and what’s not, enabling you to take proactive steps to enhance the customer experience.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><br />The absence of automation can impact agent wellbeing</h2>
<p>Let’s circle back to my earlier point about automation. Automation leads to increased efficiency and productivity levels. The push for greater efficiency is yet another reason businesses are investing in cloud and AI.</p>
<p>According to research by Gitnux, contact center agents spend 37% of their time doing unproductive work, which leads to burnout. Indeed, agents spend a great deal of their time performing repetitive and time-consuming tasks while juggling various systems and applications before, during, and after customer interactions, which, if not automated, can be challenging.</p>
<p>AI can generate automated wrap-up summaries that include suggested follow-up actions and wrap-up codes for each customer interaction. This saves time for agents while providing the business with a clearer picture of interaction data</p>
<p>AI can also use data to proactively minimize agent stress levels. Imagine having AI automatically schedule breaks when it detects potential stress for agents. For instance, if an agent has handled multiple back-to-back lengthy calls with upset customers, AI can re-route upcoming calls to other agents or switch the stressed agent to a less demanding digital channel, minimizing burnout and allowing the agent some time to reset.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Here&#8217;s what you just learned in 5 minutes</h2>
<p>AI innovation is best leveraged with modern cloud deployments. As senior <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/emilsayegh/2023/08/23/artificial-intelligence-and-clouds-a-complex-relationship-of-collaboration-and-concern/?sh=28e283a95c19" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Forbes</a> contributor Emil Sayegh puts it: “The cloud provides us with a canvas of scalability, adaptability, and cost-efficiency, and serves as a foundation upon which the full gamut of AI’s capabilities can flourish.”</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t let the limitations of your legacy on-premises contact center technology determine the quality, completeness, and ease of experiences you deliver to customers or employees.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re ready to prioritize cloud transformation and future-proof your contact center, explore <a href="https://www.webex.com/us/en/products/customer-experience/contact-center.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Webex Contact Center</a> &#8211; the AI-powered customer experience platform for today and tomorrow.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="heading2"><br />AI delivers tangible benefits for work and collaboration</h2>
<p>Hybrid work requires unique tools to enable successful collaboration for people working from an office, at home, or anywhere else. The <a href="http://www.webex.ai/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><strong>Cisco AI Assistant for Webex</strong></a> plays a key role in bolstering productivity and improving communications.</p>
<p>Organizations leveraging these advanced AI features are witnessing significant improvements in meeting effectiveness and enhanced wellbeing for both remote and hybrid employees.</p>
<p>Employees increased productivity, saving valuable time throughout the day, allowing&nbsp; them to focus on high-priority tasks:</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-423043" src="https://blog.webex.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/3.jpg" /></figure>
<p>Beyond time savings, these AI tools facilitated better communications and collaboration among team members:</p>

<p>With Webex AI, there are benefits for every workstyle. For instance, Sebastian Leuser, Solution Architect at Deutsche Telekom, shared his thoughts on his favorite Webex AI feature:</p>
<p>“I have been a long-term fan of Webex AI features such as noise removal and virtual background. However, since I started using messaging summaries, I have found a new favorite. Messaging summaries provide me with a quick overview of the discussions happening within a Webex space, allowing me to focus on the conversations that are important to me. I was amazed by the quality of the summaries from the very beginning.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Whether working remotely, in-office, or on the go, Webex AI improves collaboration and enhances the work experience like never before. <a href="https://www.webex.ai/ai-assistant-for-suite-devices-cx.html?tab=tab-suite" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><strong>Explore our latest innovations</strong></a> and features available across the Webex Suite, including:</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="heading3"><br />AI powers intelligent office experiences</h2>
<p>As many employees return to the office for at least a few days a week, traditional office setups are proving ill-equipped to support modern hybrid work. The role of the office has evolved from a mandatory place to work to a destination where employees engage in collaboration, ideation, training, and community building. However, with the rise of hybrid work, not everyone will be in the office at the same time, and only <strong><a href="https://www.webex.com/gp/hybrid-work-research-global-2024.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="">42% of employees</a></strong> believe their office is prepared to support hybrid work.</p>
<p>To create an immersive experience that makes everyone feel like an equal participant, workspaces need collaboration devices equipped with AI-driven audio and video intelligence. Cisco devices, with NVIDIA technology built in, are providing cutting-edge collaboration experiences, effectively bridging the gap between in-office teams and remote colleagues.</p>
<p>AI-powered collaboration devices have proven instrumental in boosting meeting effectiveness:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>81% reported significantly more effective meetings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>80% cited increased productivity, presentation quality, and collaboration abilities.&nbsp;</li>
<li>71% of remote workers felt a greater sense of inclusion during hybrid meetings.&nbsp;</li>
<li>86% experienced a significant reduction in fatigue and enhanced focus during meetings involving remote, in-room, or on-the-go participants.</li>
</ul>
<p>Niklas Mortensen, Managing Direct at Designit, sees the effect of AI-powered devices firsthand: “Collaboration across studios has become much more of a thing. It was not that we didn’t do it before, but now, borders don’t really matter anymore, because we can all collaborate and work remotely, and clients also see this.”</p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.webex.ai/ai-assistant-for-suite-devices-cx.html?tab=tab-devices" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><strong>audio and video intelligence</strong></a> built into each device, Cisco devices can help transform the workplace experience by bringing AI-powered capabilities to every workspace.<br /><br /></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="heading4"><br />Security and manageability in the era of AI</h2>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The IT experience</strong></h3>
<p>We&#8217;re thrilled to witness how Webex customers are utilizing AI Assistant to enhance hybrid work and deliver innovative customer experiences, but what can it do for the teams responsible for evaluating and implementing solutions and troubleshooting issues?</p>
<p>When it comes to IT, there are also substantial time savings: 73% of IT Admins expect to save up to 8 hours a week through AI-powered search. By embedding AI into Control Hub, the single-pane-of-glass management platform, IT can spend less time troubleshooting and problem-solving and focus on the more strategic role of improving the experience for every employee.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Security you can trust</strong></h3>
<p>We also know that every organization has concerns when it comes to implementing AI. According to a <a href="https://www.webex.com/gp/dimensional-research-hybrid-work-AI-research-2024.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><strong>recent research report</strong></a> by Dimensional Research, the top concern is security.</p>
<p>At Cisco, we recognize the critical importance of AI governance and the responsible implementation of AI technologies. AI Assistant meets industry-leading security standards, ensuring end-to-end, secure AI solutions for our customers. For more details, please visit <a href="https://trustportal.cisco.com/c/r/ctp/home.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=""><strong>Cisco’s Trust Portal</strong></a>.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="heading5">Conclusion</h2>
<p>These results demonstrate that AI is not just living up to the hype; it&#8217;s transforming the way we work and interact.

<p>With Webex AI, there are benefits for every workstyle. For instance, Sebastian Leuser, Solution Architect at Deutsche Telekom, shared his thoughts on his favorite Webex AI feature:</p>
<p>“I have been a long-term fan of Webex AI features such as noise removal and virtual background. However, since I started using messaging summaries, I have found a new favorite. Messaging summaries provide me with a quick overview of the discussions happening within a Webex space, allowing me to focus on the conversations that are important to me. I was amazed by the quality of the summaries from the very beginning.”&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="heading3"><br />AI powers intelligent office experiences</h2>
<p>As many employees return to the office for at least a few days a week, traditional office setups are proving ill-equipped to support modern hybrid work. The role of the office has evolved from a mandatory place to work to a destination where employees engage in collaboration, ideation, training, and community building. However, with the rise of hybrid work, not everyone will be in the office at the same time, and only <strong><a href="https://www.webex.com/gp/hybrid-work-research-global-2024.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="">42% of employees</a></strong> believe their office is prepared to support hybrid work.</p>
<p>To create an immersive experience that makes everyone feel like an equal participant, workspaces need collaboration devices equipped with AI-driven audio and video intelligence. Cisco devices, with NVIDIA technology built in, are providing cutting-edge collaboration experiences, effectively bridging the gap between in-office teams and remote colleagues.</p>
<p>AI-powered collaboration devices have proven instrumental in boosting meeting effectiveness:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>81% reported significantly more effective meetings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>80% cited increased productivity, presentation quality, and collaboration abilities.&nbsp;</li>
<li>71% of remote workers felt a greater sense of inclusion during hybrid meetings.&nbsp;</li>
<li>86% experienced a significant reduction in fatigue and enhanced focus during meetings involving remote, in-room, or on-the-go participants.</li>
</ul>
<p>Niklas Mortensen, Managing Direct at Designit, sees the effect of AI-powered devices firsthand: “Collaboration across studios has become much more of a thing. It was not that we didn’t do it before, but now, borders don’t really matter anymore, because we can all collaborate and work remotely, and clients also see this.”</p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.webex.ai/ai-assistant-for-suite-devices-cx.html?tab=tab-devices" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><strong>audio and video intelligence</strong></a> built into each device, Cisco devices can help transform the workplace experience by bringing AI-powered capabilities to every workspace.<br /><br /></p>

<title>11 valuable contact center metrics to track in 2025</title>
<link>https://blog.webex.com/customer-experience/eleven-valuable-contact-center-metrics-to-track/</link>
<guid>https://blog.webex.com/customer-experience/eleven-valuable-contact-center-metrics-to-track/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Standard contact center metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) help businesses track and measure the success of their customer experience—particularly as it relates to their call or contact centers.</p>
<p>But which KPIs are the most valuable and relevant to your contact center operation? Which can help boost agent productivity and bottom-line performance? And, most importantly, how do you improve them?</p>
<p>As we prepare to enter 2025, it&#8217;s crucial to ensure that our contact center is equipped to meet the evolving needs of our customers. By understanding and optimizing key metrics, we can position ourselves for success in delivering exceptional customer experiences.</p>
<p>This guide will explore 11 metrics to track and why they’re essential. Plus, we’ll share best practices for measuring, acting on, and enhancing your most critical KPIs.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What’s the difference between call center and contact center metrics?</h2>
<p>Before jumping into it, let’s make an important distinction:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Call centers</strong> are communication hubs that focus specifically on telephony. As such, most of the KPIs they track involve total calls, average call length, and other phone-based metrics.</li>
<li><strong>Contact centers</strong> are larger, more comprehensive, and increasingly <a href="https://blog.webex.com/customer-experience/delivering-on-the-customer-experience-imperative/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=""><strong>omnichannel</strong></a>. In addition to telephony, they handle channels like social media, email, SMS, live chat, and more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite their differences, the KPIs generally overlap. Most standard call center metrics are not only applicable but also beneficial to contact center operations. And, since <a href="https://www.businessleader.co.uk/research-phone-calls-preferred-customer-service/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=""><strong>61% of people</strong></a> still prefer phone calls for customer service, they can’t be overlooked.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">11 essential call center metrics and KPIs</h2>
<p>You can break most metrics down into three categories:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Customer experience (CX):</strong> CX KPIs help you measure customer interaction quality, which can impact how consumers feel about your brand—and in turn, customer loyalty. Low scores reflect poor satisfaction, whereas high scores represent happy, satisfied customers.</li>
<li><strong>Agent performance:</strong> This type of contact center KPI measures <a href="https://www.webex.com/products/workforce-optimization.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=""><strong>agent productivity</strong></a> and how well they’re handling each customer interaction. Why? Because agent performance directly impacts CX. These analytics, in turn, support quality assurance.</li>
<li><strong>Operational performance:</strong> Contact center performance metrics track the overall success of your operation within a given period. Improving performance metrics may reduce costs, increase profits, and enable you to deliver a better customer experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>For each of these buckets, there are numerous KPIs you might track. Let’s narrow down your choices and explore 11 of the most valuable:</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Call arrival rate</h3>
<p>Call arrival rate refers to the total number of calls, or call volume, your contact center receives in a certain period. For example, a call center manager might measure call volume per minute, hour, day, week, or month, depending on their specific needs.<br /><br />Analyzing call arrival patterns helps you anticipate peak periods of activity and adjust staffing levels accordingly. This makes it easier to maintain service level agreements and meet performance targets—plus, you can optimize workloads, avoid overwhelming employees, and reduce agent turnover.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Blocked call percentage</h3>
<p>When agents are busy and unavailable to take an incoming call, customers are typically met with a busy tone. This counts as a blocked call because a customer couldn’t get through immediately. A high percentage of blocked calls may indicate a staffing or other organizational problem.</p>
<p>Even worse, it’s a frustrating customer experience. Consumers want fast, if not immediate, responses from brands. Speed positively impacts customer loyalty: According to Forrester, people are <a href="https://www.forrester.com/blogs/whats-the-roi-of-cx-transformation/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=""><strong>twice as likely</strong></a> to stick with companies that solve their problems quickly.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Average call abandonment rate</h3>
<p>Your abandonment rate measures how many customers hang up before contacting a contact center agent. An abandoned call can happen for many reasons, which makes this tricky to analyze—but it’s essential nonetheless.</p>
<p>A rising abandonment rate signals dissatisfaction, which may be due to a high inbound call volume and too few agents around to answer. Tracking this metric over time will help identify potential causes and quantify the impact of any changes.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. First response time (FRT)</h3>
<p>FRT measures how long it takes before a customer is connected to an available agent. A slow average response time could indicate that there are too many cases for agents to handle, that agents aren’t acting quickly enough, or your technology capabilities are lacking.</p>
<p>Of course, a good FRT depends on the channel. According to CX Today, the <a href="https://www.cxtoday.com/contact-centre/what-is-first-response-time-and-how-can-i-measure-it/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=""><strong>industry standard</strong></a> for telephony is that 80% of calls are answered in 20 seconds or less.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">5. First contact resolution (FCR)</h3>
<p>First contact resolution measures the percentage of customer inquiries or issues resolved on the first attempt without the need for follow-up interactions. A high FCR indicates efficient problem-solving and customer satisfaction, whereas low scores suggest the opposite.</p>
<p>If you’re dealing with poor FCR, your agents may lack the resources to handle inquiries effectively. For instance, a lack of contextual understanding or customer data could make addressing problems at first contact challenging.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">6. Average handling time (AHT)</h3>
<p>As the name suggests, average handling time tracks the average time it takes agents to complete the customer interaction. It measures the entire duration of the engagement, including any after-call work agents must do to wrap up the case. Notably, there are other KPIs that can contribute to AHT, such as average call length or average hold time.</p>
<p>That said, high AHT doesn’t necessarily mean there’s a problem. The trick is reconciling speed and efficiency with excellent customer service. Employees who exceed handle time benchmarks may not be addressing customer needs as well as others who spend more time on the case.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">7. Customer satisfaction (CSAT)</h3>
<p>The customer satisfaction score, or CSAT, is a must-have contact center metric. CSAT scores measure customer satisfaction based on post-call surveys and feedback, usually on a scale-based system. For example, you can frame questions like this:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>On a scale of 1-10, how happy are you with your experience?</li>
<li>How would you rate your satisfaction with the interaction? (Unsatisfied, somewhat satisfied, very satisfied).</li>
</ul>
<p>Measuring CSAT scores can help managers with quality assurance by quantifying agent performance. However, qualitative responses are also valuable, as they give context to numerical data.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">8. Net promoter score (NPS)</h3>
<p>Net promoter score measures long-term customer loyalty. Like CSAT, it’s calculated through surveys, which you can send immediately after an interaction or some time afterward.</p>
<p>Most NPS surveys ask how likely the recipient is to recommend the company to others, rating their answer 1-10. This allows you to divide respondents into three groups:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Promoters (score 9-10)</strong> are highly loyal customers who will likely recommend your company.</li>
<li><strong>Passives (score 7-8)</strong> are satisfied but unenthusiastic about your brand.</li>
<li><strong>Detractors</strong> <strong>(score 0-6)</strong> are unhappy with their experience and may discourage others from engaging with your business.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">9. Customer effort score (CES)</h3>
<p>Customer effort score measures how difficult it is for consumers to fulfill their needs when they contact your company. Generally speaking, CES helps you understand whether customers must jump through hoops to get what they want and resolve their issues.</p>
<p>Notably, customer effort score is related to loyalty. According to Gartner, <strong><a href="https://emt.gartnerweb.com/ngw/globalassets/en/sales-service/documents/trends/customer-value-advantage-ebook.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="">only 37% of consumers</a></strong> remain loyal to a brand after a “high effort resolution.” On the other hand, 61% stay loyal if the experience is quick and easy.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">10. Service level rate</h3>
<p>Contact centers typically have service level agreements (SLA), which are standards used to uphold expectations and keep customers happy. For instance, on average, you might aim to answer emails within four hours or less or that all answered calls are resolved within 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Service level rates are a good way to track operational efficiency over time. They also help you identify patterns or areas of improvement.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">11. Agent turnover</h3>
<p>Turnover rates measure the percentage of employees leaving your company in a specific period, normally a year. The agent turnover rate is notoriously high for contact centers—<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4008034-1&amp;h=2636326688&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fecommons.cornell.edu%2Fserver%2Fapi%2Fcore%2Fbitstreams%2Fe4ae98ca-9034-4f68-8be9-86885905f403%2Fcontent&amp;a=study" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=""><strong>twice that</strong></a> of other industries. There are many reasons someone might leave your company, but burnout is responsible for at least 50% of cases, costing organizations millions of dollars each year.</p>
<p>Tracking turnover is vital, not just for business performance but for employee well-being. A high churn rate could suggest agents are overwhelmed, possibly by call volume or other factors. It may even indicate operational or procedural issues that require fixing.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to enhance metrics for a better contact center operation</h2>
<p></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-423043" src="https://webexblogstg.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/enhance-metrics-for-a-better-contact-center.jpg" /></figure>
<p></p>
<p>Once you know what to measure, how do you boost your numbers? Here are some best practices for giving your contact center a lift:</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Optimize call-handling processes</h3>
<p>A great way to significantly drive improvements is by focusing on your call-handling strategies. Some measures you can take include:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Streamline call routing and escalation processes to minimize hold times and ensure calls are directed to the most appropriate agent or department. Skills-based routing, for instance, can automatically distribute cases to employees based on their proficiencies, ensuring inquiries are handled effectively.</li>
<li>Implement scripting and call flow guidelines to standardize interactions and ensure consistency in service quality.</li>
<li>Encourage active listening and empathy among agents to build rapport with customers and enhance their overall experience.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Enhance contact center technology</h3>
<p>Advanced platforms can provide a full suite of solutions tailored to call center operations and the customer experience. For example, Webex Contact Center allows you to:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Leverage voice- and text-based virtual agents, automatic call distribution (ACD) systems, and more. These tools not only provide self-service options for customers to find answers independently but they also free human agents of mundane tasks.</li>
<li>Use analytics tools to track and analyze metrics in real time, all from one convenient source of truth. Comprehensive dashboards make it easy to identify trends and make data-driven decisions.</li>
<li>Harness <a href="https://www.webex.com/products/contact-center-AI.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=""><strong>artificial intelligence</strong></a> (AI) to empower agents with full contextual knowledge, past customer histories, suggested responses, and more. These capabilities reduce burnout while also maximizing agent productivity and improving customer satisfaction.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Gather and act on customer feedback</h3>
<p>What better way to collect insights than your customers themselves? Webex Contact Center, you can:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Implement post-call surveys or feedback mechanisms to feed data into your analytics dashboard automatically.</li>
<li>Analyze customer feedback to identify recurring issues or areas for improvement and take proactive steps to address them, such as by coaching agents.</li>
<li>Drive continuous improvement initiatives and prioritize those that will impact customer satisfaction most.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Give call center agents the tools they need to succeed</h3>
<p>Measuring performance is easy with a comprehensive platform that automatically collects and analyzes data. With Webex Contact Center, you not only gain a fully featured suite of AI-powered capabilities but also the means to activate insights at scale. Generate reports, pinpoint patterns, and identify achievements—all from one pane of glass.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.webex.com/suite/enterprise-cloud-calling.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="">Webex Calling</a> delivers enterprise-grade cloud calling to over 15 million users across <a href="https://www.webex.com/products/calling-global-availability.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="">170+ countries</a> around the world. To support our growing global installed base, we’re excited to announce the launch of a second calling data center in the UK. This expansion supports our enterprise customers and partners in the UK by providing improved service reliability, enhanced compliance, and solutions for evolving regulatory requirements post-Brexit.</p>
<p>Our new Webex Calling data center is located in Manchester and complements our existing data center in London. Both UK data centers support multi-tenant and <a href="https://help.webex.com/en-us/article/dk3o5r/Introduction-to-Dedicated-Instance" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="">Dedicated Instance</a> deployment models for Webex Calling. The addition of Cisco’s second UK data center for Webex Calling ensures that both active and redundant calling media and signaling data remains within the UK region.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Our second UK data center will benefit Webex Calling customers in commercial and enterprise markets, as well as regulated industries such as finance and government, that require calling (media and signaling) data to reside in the UK.</p>
<p>Webex Calling is committed to delivering high quality, secure, reliable, and compliant enterprise-grade cloud calling services to our customers around the globe. The launch of our second UK data center follows the recent launch of media PoPs in the <a href="https://blog.webex.com/cloud-calling/cisco-expands-webex-calling-and-contact-center-media-presence-in-uae/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="">United Arab Emirates</a>, Brazil, and <a href="https://blog.webex.com/cloud-calling/south-korea-data-center/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="">South Korea</a>.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Customer expectations and the way customers engage with businesses have forever changed. The new reality is that customers expect to interact with businesses via any digital channel, not just over the phone. And if they do pick up the phone to talk to your customer service team, they also expect you to know who they are and what they need from your company.</p>
<p>The most memorable customer experiences are created when agents have historical context about the customer, are armed with the right resources to serve them, and are given intuitive collaboration tools to get help from other teams to quickly solve for their customer’s needs. This means that customer service is no longer an afterthought but has become the front door, and customer service agents are now the face of the company to provide memorable first impressions. In fact, providing exceptional customer experience is now every employee’s responsibility, not just limited to a specific department.</p>
<p></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Many business functions benefit from process optimization—and your contact center is no exception. Streamlining contact center workflows means less stress on your agents, faster resolutions for your customers, and more money in your pocket.</p>
<p>Here, we’re talking all about contact center optimization including how to augment your processes, which KPIs to track, and more.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why you should optimize your contact center</h2>
<p>Efficient contact center operations are not just advantageous, but instead necessary for sustained business. With disjointed processes and inefficient workflows, your contact center cannot run at an optimal pace and function as it should.</p>
<p>When things start to slow down as a result of disorganization, you risk:</p>
<ol>
</ol>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What’s standing in the way of contact center optimization?</h2>
<p></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-423043" src="https://webexblogstg.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/way-contact-center-optimization.jpg" /></figure>
<p></p>
<p>Businesses face a handful of hurdles between where they currently are and a fully optimized contact center operation—some of them are real, others are perceived. Effective optimization involves identifying the following challenges with clarity, addressing them systematically, and implementing targeted solutions to overcome these obstacles and drive continual improvement.</p>
<p><strong>Legacy systems and infrastructure:</strong> Outdated technology infrastructure notoriously limits the ability of contact centers to adopt new tools that can improve their customer service processes. Legacy systems often lack compatibility with modern software solutions, such as cloud-based services and artificial intelligence (AI)-driven omnichannel communication platforms. This incompatibility can result in expensive and disruptive overhauls, acting as a significant optimization barrier.</p>
<p><strong>Budget constraints:</strong> Both the software and hardware associated with contact center optimization—such as advanced VoIP phones, high-performance servers, and CRM systems, among other assets—often require significant investment. Fortunately, there are cost-effective, yet highly efficient contact center solutions available that allow organizations to optimally function and scale. To those ends, <strong><a href="https://www.webex.com/us/en/products/customer-experience/contact-center.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="">Webex Contact Center</a></strong> provides agents with AI-driven insights and tools—integrating seamlessly with existing systems to offer flexible, scalable solutions that accommodate various budgetary constraints.</p>
<p><strong>Data silos and integration challenges:</strong> The use of multiple platforms leads to scattered data, complicating efforts to create a unified view of customer interactions, agent responsiveness, and other key metrics. This fragmentation obstructs efficient service delivery as agents cannot access complete customer histories or insights from other communication channels, leading to service gaps.</p>
<p><strong>High contact center agent turnover:</strong> With <strong><a href="https://ecommons.cornell.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/e4ae98ca-9034-4f68-8be9-86885905f403/content" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="">44% of agents</a> </strong>actively seeking new work, contact centers face continual disruptions to service continuity and quality. Constant agent training and hiring drain resources and focus from strategic initiatives—degrading the quality of customer service as new agents take time to reach the proficiency of their predecessors.</p>
<p><strong>Resistance to change:</strong> While <strong><a href="https://www.pritchettnet.com/how-much-resistance-to-change-is-normal-0#:~:text=Another%2050%20percent%20of%20the,30%20percent%20are%20the%20resisters." rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="">half of employees</a></strong> are neutral to change, approximately 30% are reluctant. That leaves just 20% who are open to new processes that can improve operations. Hence why strategic change management is so important. Rather than abruptly imposing new systems and practices, successful change management involves engaging with and educating employees on the benefits of new technologies and processes, thereby fostering receptiveness.</p>
<p>To address these challenges, businesses need to use a solution that’s easily adaptable, compatible, and conducive with operational needs. <strong><a href="https://www.webex.com/us/en/products/customer-experience/contact-center.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="">Webex Contact Center</a></strong> is just that: a comprehensive and adaptable platform that seamlessly integrates with both new and existing systems. This compatibility eases the transition for businesses moving from legacy systems to advanced, AI-driven solutions. By providing agents with AI-driven tools and valuable insights within a cost-effective framework, Webex Contact Center enables organizations to overcome budget constraints, data silos, high agent turnover, and resistance to change, thereby facilitating optimal contact center performance.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to optimize your contact center</h2>
<p></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-423043" src="https://webexblogstg.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/optimize-your-contact-center.jpg" /></figure>
<p></p>
<p>Optimizing a contact center involves a strategic approach to managing resources, integrating technology, monitoring performance, continuously training staff, refining processes, and supporting multiple communication channels.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Resource management</h3>
<p>Effective resource management is anchored in predictive analytics and real-time responsiveness. By leveraging historical data, contact center managers can predict peak periods and adjust staffing levels accordingly. Predictive analytics tools analyze past trends, considering variables such as time of day, seasonal demand, and marketing campaigns. This data informs a dynamic contact center scheduling system that aligns agent shifts with anticipated call volumes, ensuring optimal staffing without underutilization or overload.</p>
<p>Moreover, real-time monitoring tools enable immediate adjustments to staffing when unexpected deviations from predictions occur, thus maintaining service levels without incurring unnecessary labor costs.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Technology integration</h3>
<p>A unified agent desktop that integrates CRM, ACD, IVR, and outbound communication tools into one interface reduces the time agents spend navigating systems, thereby decreasing Average Handle Time (AHT) and improving the customer experience. Additionally, advanced IVR systems can be used not only for routing but also for resolving standard inquiries without agent intervention, effectively decreasing call volumes.</p>
<p>Today, integration extends to include AI. Generative AI-fueled chatbots are increasingly handling initial customer interactions, gathering necessary information, and solving routine problems. These AI-fueled chatbots can process natural language, understand customer intent, and provide accurate responses based on the data accessed from integrated systems. Their advanced capabilities have led to <strong><a href="https://masterofcode.com/blog/chatbot-statistics" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="">more than seven out of ten</a></strong> customers (74%) saying that they prefer to speak to AI for simple queries, rather than human agents.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Performance monitoring and analysis</h3>
<p>Optimizing your contact center means adopting a data-driven approach. To help measure the effectiveness of your contact center, you can track the following key performance indicators (KPIs).</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Average handle time (AHT): </strong>Average Handle Time refers to the average duration agents take to handle a customer interaction from start to finish. This includes talk time, hold time, and the time spent on related tasks after the customer interaction ends (after-call work).<br /><br />AHT is calculated using the formula:<br /><br /><em>AHT = Total talk time + total hold time + total after-call work time ÷ total number of calls handled</em><br /><br />AHT is typically measured using telephony and customer support software that automatically logs these times for each agent interaction.<br /><br /></li>
<li><strong>First-call resolution rate</strong>: First-call resolution rate measures the percentage of customer issues or inquiries resolved during the first interaction, without the need for any follow-up. FCR can be tracked through CRM systems where agents mark whether an issue was resolved in the first interaction, and this can be corroborated with follow-up data.<br /><br />FCR is calculated by dividing the number of calls resolved on the first contact by the total number of calls, then multiplying by 100 to express it as a percentage.<br /><br /><em>FCR = ( total number of calls ÷ number of first contact resolutions ​) x 100%</em><br /><br /></li>
<li><strong>Response time</strong>: Response time is the average time it takes for a customer to receive a response from an agent upon initiating contact, whether through a call, chat, email, or any other support channel.<br />For calls, it is the time from when a call is received to when an agent answers it. For digital customer inquiries like emails or chat messages, it is the time from the customer’s message to an agent’s first reply.<br /><br /></li>
<li><strong>Customer satisfaction scores (CSAT):</strong> Customer satisfaction scores measure how satisfied customers are with their interaction with the contact center.<br /><br />CSAT is typically calculated by asking customers to rate their satisfaction on a scale—i.e., 1 to 5, or 1 to 10. The scores from these ratings are then averaged to provide a composite score. Often, only top box responses—i.e., ratings of 5 on a 5-point scale—are considered in calculating a percentage of satisfied customers.<br /><br /></li>
<li><strong>Agent productivity: </strong>Agent productivity measures the agents’ efficiency in handling customer interactions and is often assessed by the volume of interactions they manage within a given period.<br /><br />This can be measured in terms of the number of calls handled, emails responded to, or chat sessions managed per hour or per shift. Productivity metrics are recorded and analyzed through the same CRM or customer interaction management software that tracks other KPIs, providing a dashboard view of individual and team performance.<br /></li>
</ul>
<p>By systematically measuring these KPIs, contact centers can identify performance bottlenecks, training needs, and opportunities for process improvement—all aimed at enhancing the overall customer experience and operational efficiency.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Training and development</h3>
<p>Effective training ultimately yields a better employee experience. Training and development in a contact center must be an ongoing effort that adapts to emerging needs and technologies. This requires a structured training program that includes initial intensive training sessions for new hires and continuous learning opportunities for existing staff.</p>
<p>Utilizing a blend of e-learning, instructor-led training, and peer mentoring can accommodate different learning styles and ensure comprehensive knowledge transfer. Moreover, simulation-based training and real-time coaching using analytics from live calls can further enhance training effectiveness, helping agents improve their skills in handling complex scenarios.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Process optimization</h3>
<p>Continuous process optimization requires you to regularly review existing workflows, identify bottlenecks, and implement improvements. This may involve automating data entry tasks, streamlining information retrieval processes, or redesigning the escalation path for complex issues. Each process change should aim to reduce effort and time from the customer’s and agent’s perspective, measured by reduced interaction times and improved satisfaction scores.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Multichannel support</h3>
<p>Ensuring effective multichannel support involves integrating various communication platforms while maintaining consistency in service quality across all channels. This requires a unified agent interface that provides comprehensive customer context irrespective of the communication channel.</p>
<p>Specifically, the unified interface should allow agents to seamlessly access customer information, interaction history, and any previous concerns raised across channels such as phone, email, chat, and social media. This integration helps prevent redundancy and ensures that customers do not have to repeat information, enhancing the customer experience. Additionally, the system should be equipped with functionality to switch between channels effectively, allowing agents to continue conversations on different platforms without loss of context or service quality.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In today&#8217;s dynamic business landscape, it&#8217;s essential to provide exceptional customer experiences (CX) efficiently while alleviating the burden on agents. This requires the use of automation and related technologies to expedite and manage manual processes, ensuring they keep up with fast-changing customer expectations.</p>
<p>Fortunately, business process automation offers a solution, particularly tools such as artificial intelligence (AI). These innovative tools enable companies to streamline contact center operations, making tasks more manageable and, at the same time:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Uplift the employee experience</li>
<li>Improve customer satisfaction</li>
<li>Increase operational efficiency</li>
<li>Maximize the return on investment (ROI)</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#8217;s crucial to strategically implement automation in business processes. To begin, we&#8217;ll discuss emerging contact center trends that are shaping the future of automation and offer insights on how your business can make the most of these developments.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">10 trends shaping contact center automation</h2>
<p>Staying updated on automation can help keep your business on the cutting edge. Let’s review the 10 most powerful contact center automation trends:</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1: Conversational AI for self-service</h3>
<p>According to Deloitte’s <a href="https://www.deloittedigital.com/us/en/insights/research/contact-center-survey.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=""><strong>2023 survey</strong></a>, contact centers rank new self-service capabilities as their top investment priority. In fact, 90% of leaders will invest in such solutions over the next two years, citing a desire to increase virtual agent interactions.</p>
<p>In short, a virtual agent is an example of robotic process automation. It uses conversational AI and natural language processing to handle routine tasks and customer issues without human agent intervention. This can streamline first-contact resolution and improve customer satisfaction, providing fast and easy support.</p>
<p>Generally, these self-service tools come in two varieties:</p>
<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Chatbots:</strong> Organizations can embed live chat features on websites where consumers ask the virtual agent questions. It can direct the user to relevant resources and departments, routing them based on a company and customer data knowledge base.</li>
<li><strong>Interactive voice response (IVR):</strong> Voice-based virtual agents can augment IVR systems with intelligent automation. Much like a chatbot, conversational IVRs process information in real time, allowing them to respond with relevant answers.</li>
</ol>
<p>These systems provide a tangible boost to operational efficiency. <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/operations/our-insights/operations-blog/why-ivr-still-matters-in-an-ai-world" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=""><strong>McKinsey estimates</strong></a> that IVR systems can improve customer satisfaction (CSAT) scores by five times and reduce the number of live-agent calls by over 10%.</p>
<p>By streamlining routine tasks, automation technology empowers contact center agents to focus on other responsibilities, knowing that the system can automatically elevate the user to a human agent for more complex inquiries while retaining a complete history of the previous interaction.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Sentiment analysis and speech analytics</h3>
<p>The rapid growth of speech analytics is another automation trend leaning heavily on artificial intelligence. Combined with sentiment analysis, this emerging technology is helping contact center agents gain insight into consumer sentiment.</p>
<p>How does it work? Machine learning algorithms use natural language understanding (NLU) to process phonetic signals. In other words, it analyzes the customer’s speech pattern and tone during the interaction. Then, it classifies the call as positive, neutral, or negative.</p>
<p>This solution provides valuable insight into the customer experience. For instance, supervisors can compare scores against automated transcripts to understand why the call was positive or negative. This can help improve agent training and script compliance, not to mention quality assurance.</p>
<p>Plus, there’s a real business impact. According to McKinsey, speech analytics can drive cost savings of up to 30% and improve CSAT scores by 10%.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Customer-centricity</h3>
<p>The third trend shaping contact center automation is the continued rise of customer-centricity. The idea is simple: Putting customer needs first won’t only improve your brand image, but it can also lead to several <strong><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2023/10/18/benefits-and-pitfalls-of-the-customer-first-business-approach/?sh=62e53e464437" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="">competitive advantages</a>.</strong> For example, customer-centric organizations can expect:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Stronger retention</strong>: A positive customer experience may lead to more frequent purchases, maximizing lifetime value.</li>
<li><strong>Reduced churn:</strong> Meeting customer expectations will delight consumers, giving them fewer reasons to abandon their brands for a competitor.</li>
<li><strong>Better decision-making:</strong> Focusing on CX allows you to analyze customer behavior. These findings, in turn, provide valuable insight into preferences, trends, and motivations.</li>
</ul>
<p>As this new service model grows popular, organizations can leverage automation technology to make it more targeted and effective. After all, no two consumers are the same—and that’s why customer interaction analytics are so important.</p>
<p>AI-powered contact center solutions can automatically capture, transcribe, and analyze interactions. This makes it easier to understand the nuance behind granular customer needs and whether agents are meeting them effectively. Topic analysis, for example, provides insight into why consumers are reaching out. Moreover, it allows you to view trending topics and identify areas of interest or potential friction.</p>
<p>By mining interaction data, automation technology makes driving continuous improvement easier. This means you can pinpoint patterns in associate activity and customer feedback—and, in turn, develop ways to improve agent productivity, customer satisfaction, and operational efficiency, paving the way for a brighter future.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Generative AI for agent assistance</h3>
<p>Perhaps the most impactful automation trend is that of generative AI. Powered by large language models (LLMs), this type of artificial intelligence is uniquely adept at producing various forms of content, including original text, audio, and imagery.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2023-08-30-gartner-reveals-three-technologies-that-will-transform-customer-service-and-support-by-2028" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=""><strong>Gartner predicts</strong></a> that by 2025, 80% of customer service and customer support organizations will use it to improve agent productivity and CX. Why? Because the use cases are practically endless, and the technology is readily available.</p>
<p>Webex Contact Center, for instance, offers a suite of <a href="https://www.webex.ai/ai-assistant-for-suite-devices-cx.html?tab=tab-cx" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=""><strong>generative capabilities</strong></a>:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Chat summarization:</strong> People hate repeating themselves, which often happens when chatbots escalate customer issues to a human agent. Generative AI can eliminate this pain point by automatically creating a recap of every chat, call, and conversation—even ones that drop. This ensures full contextual awareness and seamless transition between channels.</li>
<li><strong>Suggested responses:</strong> As a virtual assistant, AI tools can automatically recommend replies based on customer data, such as their previous interactions and behaviors. This speeds up the response process, supporting operational efficiency while giving customers the answers they need faster than ever.</li>
<li><strong>Automated agent answers:</strong> Generative AI can expedite the interaction by tapping into the company’s knowledge base for quick, accurate answers. For example, it can make suggestions for articles that address customer inquiries, highlighting the most relevant part of the content for easy reference.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">5. AI-powered burnout detection</h3>
<p></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-423043" src="https://webexblogstg.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/ai-powered-burnout-detection.jpg" /></figure>
<p></p>
<p>Contact center agents work hard to deliver a positive customer experience. Going above and beyond can have negative impacts on the workforce. In fact, according to a <a href="https://ecommons.cornell.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/e4ae98ca-9034-4f68-8be9-86885905f403/content" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=""><strong>2020 study</strong></a>, agent turnover is double that of any other industry. Burnout causes 50% of the churn, which costs businesses nearly $5 million annually on average.</p>
<p>That’s a big problem, but fortunately, <a href="https://www.webex.com/products/workforce-optimization.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=""><strong>technology provides several solutions</strong></a>. For instance, Webex Contact Center offers AI-powered agent burnout detection. It’s an automation tool that uses AI to identify agents at risk of burning out, allowing supervisors to step in and lend a hand.</p>
<p>In addition to wellness, Webex can help managers coach agents to success, such as after a difficult call or part of the regular training process. AI-driven coaching highlights generate a centralized dashboard where you can quickly view the highest- and lowest-rated interactions.</p>
<p>This tool summarizes the conversation and recommends ways to coach employees based on its findings. This way, whether identifying best practices or inefficiencies, you can always drive continuous improvement.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">6. The proliferation of omnichannel customer support</h3>
<p>Today’s businesses are committed to meeting customer needs, wherever they may be. The only problem? Consumers are using more channels than ever before, especially when it comes to brand engagement. This has given rise to omnichannel contact center solutions, which use technology to manage all communication channels under one comprehensive roof.</p>
<p>Unified CX platforms provide agents with a single interface to access voice, SMS, live chat, email, and social media. This means employees can jump between tasks without skipping a beat. Moreover, thanks to their open architecture, organizations can remove the barriers between disparate platforms, enabling cross-channel data collection.</p>
<p>Why does this matter? It allows you to build more accurate profiles based on the latest customer data. This information drives personalization, which makes for more effective customer journey orchestration.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">7. Predictive analytics</h3>
<p>The contact center analytics market will reach <a href="https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/contact-center-analytics-market-A16642" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=""><strong>$8.1 billion</strong></a> by 2031. At that point, many organizations will leverage predictive analytics to their advantage. How? Here are some of the most notable use cases:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Workforce management:</strong> Predictive analytics use historical data to forecast call volumes, allowing you to optimize staffing decisions. They also factor historical trends and employee availability into the equation, ensuring you’re never under or over-staffed relative to customer demand. This can help reduce administrative effort while improving the employee experience.</li>
<li><strong>Customer behavior:</strong> Imagine knowing whether a specific customer is likely to churn. That type of knowledge would allow you to make informed decisions on retaining them, such as by sending them a personalized offer. Likewise, you can leverage AI’s predictive capabilities to estimate their Net Promote Score following an interaction.</li>
<li><strong>Auto dialing:</strong> Predictive dialers are a form of workflow automation that can help outbound contact centers improve their outreach. They place calls even before agents become available, thereby engaging as many leads as possible. In the case of an unanswered call, they move on to the next lead. But, if someone picks up, they route them to the next available agent. This enhances customer engagement while maximizing agent productivity.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">8. Advanced digital security</h3>
<p>Of course, of all contact center automation trends, none are quite as important as the need for advanced security. Cybercriminals and bad actors are targeting organizations at an accelerated rate, eager to exploit customer data. With their methods getting smarter and more sophisticated, introducing automated protection has never been so important.</p>
<p>When it comes to financial services, such as banking or credit unions, it&#8217;s crucial for the customer support team to verify the caller&#8217;s identity before sharing any personal or financial information. The conventional method involves asking the customer a series of questions to confirm their identity. However, this approach has two main drawbacks:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>It’s ineffective if a bad actor can access the customer’s personal information and easily bypass the authentication questions.</li>
<li>It can be a tedious and burdensome process for legitimate users who want quick access to customer support.</li>
</ul>
<p>Modern contact center solutions offer alternative ways to verify identity without compromising security or the customer experience. With an open architecture platform, organizations can integrate AI-powered biometric authentication tools.</p>
<p>Rather than questioning the customer, they use vocal analytics and/or facial recognition to verify they are who they claim to be. This process is much faster but also more adept at identifying potential fraud.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">9. Intelligent routing and call queuing</h3>
<p>Routing is one of the most basic contact center functions but also one of the most essential. Manually deciding how to route inbound cases can be slow, error-prone, and inefficient. That’s why modern contact center platforms use workflow automation to streamline and simplify the process.</p>
<p>Predictive routing strategies allocate cases to the most appropriate agent based on predefined criteria. In the case of skills-based routing, you can grade agents according to their talents and/or areas of expertise. IVR systems will automatically route inbound customers to the employee who’s best equipped to handle their type of inquiry.</p>
<p>Similarly, AI-powered tools can also simplify call queue management. Using predictive analytics, they can estimate wait times for customers in the queue. They also announce the caller’s place in line, letting them know they’re steadily advancing to the front. Plus, customers can schedule a callback if they don’t want to wait, which the IVR can place automatically.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">10. Continued rise of cloud infrastructure</h3>
<p>It’s no secret that cloud-based solutions are becoming more popular. Not only are they inherently more scalable than traditional systems, but they easily integrate with other services. This enables more advanced automation technology, which, of course, enhances operational efficiency.</p>
<p>Better yet, cloud platforms don’t require an enormous upfront investment. Delivered as a service, they help you transform your customer support team into a strategic asset—not a cost center. In fact, according to <a href="https://www.webex.com/gp/forrester-tei-contact-center.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=""><strong>Forrester Consulting</strong></a>, Cisco’s cloud-based Webex Contact Center can generate an ROI of over 300%.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Find your ideal automation solution</h3>
<p>Intelligent automation is a smart move if customer experience is critical to your business. That’s why we’ve built Webex Contact Center with a suite of innovative, automated, and AI-powered solutions.</p>
<p>From generative AI for agent assistance to conversational AI for self-service, our cloud-based platform is fully stocked with all the tools you need to turn CX into a competitive advantage. With workforce optimization, intelligent routing, and omnichannel support, Webex Contact Center can take your operations to the next level.</p>

<title>Driving sustainable hybrid work with Cisco devices</title>

<guid>https://blog.webex.com/workspaces/driving-sustainable-hybrid-work-with-cisco-devices/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Sustainability and hybrid work goes <strong><a href="https://blogs.cisco.com/our-corporate-purpose/sustainability-101-how-hybrid-work-can-advance-sustainability-in-the-workforce" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">together</a></strong>. Equipping your offices with beautifully designed Cisco devices allows you to bridge the distance between teams, leverage powerful data and insights, and infuse your workspaces with intelligence. It can also help you get closer to your sustainability goals. From circular design to active usage and optimization, all the way down to end-of-life management. Because we don’t just care about our own net-zero journey. We care about yours, too.</p>
<div>

</div>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Circular design</h2>
<p>As a society, we are using more natural resources than our planet can regenerate. It’s our responsibility to move from a linear consumption-based model to a circular one that looks beyond the current take-make-waste model and takes better care of our limited natural resources.</p>
<p>Cisco has committed to having 100 percent of new products and packaging to incorporate <strong><a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/m/en_us/about/csr/esg-hub/environment/product-sustainability.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">circular design principles</a> </strong>by 2025.  These principles encompass material use, standardization and modularization, packaging and accessories, smart energy consumption, and disassembly, reuse and repair. But what goes on behind the scenes, and how are we delivering on this when designing devices? The Cisco Devices business unit recently hit a big milestone – shipping 52.6% total post-consumer recycled plastic (PCR) in Q3, Fiscal Year 2024.</p>
<p>To exemplify how we translate these circular design principles to tangible sustainability outcomes, let’s have a look at the new 9800 Desk Phone series, which we launched at Enterprise Connect this year.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-425166" height="600" src="https://webexblogstg.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Cisco-devices-circular-design.jpg" width="980" /></figure>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>More than 74% of the plastic in the product is PCR plastic.</li>
<li>100% recyclable packaging.</li>
<li>Less than 2% paint</li>
<li>Over 93% of the main mechanical parts by weight could be disassembled by a common hand tool for ease of recycling, including plastic, metal, rubber, etc.&nbsp;</li>
<li>EnergyStar certified</li>
<li>Low-power modes for energy efficiency</li>
</ul>
<p>Moving into the meeting room and comparing our Cisco Room Bar to its predecessor, the Room Kit Mini, we reduced the packaging volume by 17 liters, allowing for 18 more units to be stacked on a pallet, increasing shipping efficiencies. We have minimized the use of single-use plastic and foam and created a 100% recyclable packaging that is expected to eliminate up to 165,000 pounds of packaging material per year. In addition to all of this, the Cisco Room Bar has been designed to be easy to repair, refurbish and recycle, extending and optimizing its overall lifecycle – just like the rest of our devices.<br /></p>

<div class="bc-video-wrapper"> 
<div>


</div>
</div>
<p></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Active usage</h2>
<p>Cisco is working to reduce its Scope 3 emissions, and as a result, our customers’ emissions by engineering more energy-efficient products. However, simply making energy efficient products is not enough – we must create solutions that help optimize energy usage. Cue Office Hours – a feature within Control Hub that allows you to turn off always-on features such as digital signage and automatic wakeups for a set number of hours. The device then goes into standby mode, which both helps you to save energy and extend the lifetime of your screens. A lot of our devices can go into a “deep sleep” mode, called Networked Standby. For example, when the Cisco Board Pro goes into a networked standby mode, we reduce the energy consumption&nbsp;by between 85% and 89%, depending on the model. * This radically reduces your energy bills and your emissions. Want to dig deeper into the different devices&#8217; energy consumption in different states? Check out&nbsp;our Cisco devices&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/td/docs/telepresence/endpoint/technical-papers/cisco-collaboration-devices-power-consumption-management.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><strong>power consumption management paper.</strong></a> </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Optimization and reporting</h2>
<p>You cannot improve what you cannot measure. Leveraging the power of our platform, you can find an overview of your devices’ energy usage and associated carbon emissions in the sustainability tab in Control Hub. The carbon emission estimates from the devices’ usage are based on standardized formulas from agencies like the U.S Environmental Protection Agency, however admins can also input their own power-to-CO2 emission factors. Additionally, you can <strong><a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/td/docs/telepresence/endpoint/technical-papers/cisco-collaboration-devices-power-consumption-management.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">pull reports</a> </strong> on the devices’ power consumption in different modes and use that information to create custom calculations – making sustainability reporting that much easier.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">End-of-life management</h2>
<p>Cisco has committed to having 100% product returns. This is why we have The Cisco Takeback and Reuse Program. This program lets Cisco equipment owners return hardware that has reached end-of-use, at no cost. As always with Cisco, security is a top priority, so any returned equipment is stored in a secure location and data is cleared from returned hard drives to protect data security.</p>
<p>By investing in Cisco devices, you are not only investing in amazing hybrid employee experiences, but also in quality, longevity and sustainability. Learn more about our sustainability efforts <a href="https://www.cisco.com/site/us/en/about/purpose/environmental-sustainability/index.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><strong>here.</strong></a></p>

<guid>https://blog.webex.com/collaboration/announcing-the-availability-of-industry-first-webex-ai-codec-transforming-your-audio-experiences/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>We announced our <a href="https://webexblogstg.wpenginepowered.com/hybrid-work/next-level-audio-with-webex-ai-codec/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><strong>industry-first Webex AI Codec last year</strong></a> and I am very excited to share that it is now generally available (GA), in the Webex app, enabling you to intelligently transform your audio experiences during calls and meetings.</p>
<p>Here at <a href="https://www.webex.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><strong>Webex</strong></a>, we continue to focus on creating exceptional experiences between employees and customers. Today, AI plays an important role in the way we collaborate and interact with each other, and our pervasive AI across the Webex Platform works silently in the background to improve communications, productivity and remove barriers whether collaborating internally or externally.</p>
<p>Even though the AI conversation feels new, we have been implementing AI into the entire Webex portfolio for the last decade.&nbsp;Webex has been at the forefront with <strong> <a href="https://www.webex.ai/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">AI innovations</a></strong>  and is known for delivering industry-leading video and audio quality, starting with our <a href="https://youtu.be/yZbw188QcN8?si=NA0MFJxgeSS8bnTe" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><strong>award-winning background noise cancelation</strong></a> that enables you to work anywhere, without having to worry about crowded or loud environments.

<p></p>
<div>

</div>
<p></p>
<p>As employees continue to embrace the hybrid workplace, often they work from mobile locations or on the go, which can result in poor audio quality, especially in challenging network conditions. When you’re on a call with someone, who is either driving or in an area with poor network conditions, we hear choppy audio and speech that is unintelligible. Current audio innovations and mitigation techniques, such as packet loss concealment, do not sufficiently address high packet loss scenarios.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Industry first Webex AI Codec: Experience next-level audio clarity</h2>
<p>Now, Webex AI Codec addresses these scenarios with a single, end-to-end solution for speech enhancement and highly resilient communications, ensuring crystal clear audio anywhere, on any device, under any conditions.
